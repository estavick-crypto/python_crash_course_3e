**P R E F A C E T O T H E T H I R D E D I T I O N**

The response to the first and second editions of *Python Crash Course* has   
been overwhelmingly positive. More than one million copies are in print,   
including translations in over 10 languages. I've received letters and emails   
from readers as young as 10, as well as from retirees who want to learn to   
program in their free time. *Python Crash Course* is being used in middle   
schools and high schools, and also in college classes. Students who are   
assigned more advanced textbooks are using *Python Crash Course* as a com-  
panion text for their classes and finding it a worthwhile supplement. People   
are using it to enhance their skills on the job, change careers, and start   
working on their own side projects. In short, people are using the book for   
the full range of purposes I had hoped they would, and much more.

The opportunity to write a third edition of *Python Crash Course* has been

thoroughly enjoyable. Although Python is a mature language, it continues to   
evolve as every language does. My main goal in revising the book is to keep   
it a well-curated introductory Python course. By reading this book, you'll   
learn everything you need to start working on your own projects, and you'll   
build a solid foundation for all of your future learning as well. I've updated   
some sections to reflect newer, simpler ways of doing things in Python. I've   
also clarified some sections where certain details of the language were not   
presented as accurately as they could have been. All the projects have been   
completely updated using popular, well-maintained libraries that you can   
confidently use to build your own projects.

Preface to the Third Edition

The following is a summary of specific changes that have been made in

the third edition:

â¢

[Chapter 1](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#41) now features the text editor VS Code, which is popular   
among beginner and professional programmers and works well on all   
operating systems.

â¢

[Chapter 2](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#41) includes the new methods

removeprefix()

and

removesuffix()

,

which are helpful when working with files and URLs. This chapter also   
features Python's newly improved error messages, which provide much   
more specific information to help you troubleshoot your code when   
something goes wrong.

â¢

Chapter 10 uses the

pathlib

module for working with files. This is a

much simpler approach to reading from and writing to files.

â¢

[Chapter 11](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#247) uses

pytest

to write automated tests for the code you write.

The

pytest

library has become the industry standard tool for writing

tests in Python. It's friendly enough to use for your first tests, and if you   
pursue a career as a Python programmer, you'll use it in professional   
settings as well.

â¢

The *Alien Invasion* project in Chapter[s 12â](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#265)[14 i](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#315)ncludes a setting to   
control the frame rate, which makes the game run more consistently   
across different operating systems. A simpler approach is used to build   
the fleet of aliens, and the overall organization of the project has been   
cleaned up as well.

â¢

The data visualization projects in Chapters [15--](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#339)[17 u](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#393)se the most recent   
features of Matplotlib and Plotly. The Matplotlib visualizations feature   
updated style settings. The random walk project has a small improvement   
that increases the accuracy of the plots, which means you'll see a wider   
variety of patterns emerge each time you generate a new walk. All the   
projects featuring Plotly now use the Plotly Express module, which lets   
you generate your initial visualizations with just a few lines of code. You   
can easily explore a variety of visualizations before committing to one   
kind of plot, and then focus on refining individual elements of that plot.

â¢

The Learning Log project in Chapter[s 18â](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#411)[20](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#471) is built using the latest ver-  
sion of Django and styled using the latest version of Bootstrap. Some parts   
of the project have been renamed to make it easier to follow the overall   
organization of the project. The project is now deployed to Platform.sh,   
a modern hosting service for Django projects. The deployment process   
is controlled by YAML configuration files, which give you a great deal of   
control over how your project is deployed. This approach is consistent with   
how professional programmers deploy modern Django projects.

â¢

[Appendix A h](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#501)as been fully updated to recommend current best practices   
for installing Python on all major operating systems. [Appendix B](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#507) includes   
detailed instructions for setting up VS Code, and brief descriptions of   
most of the major text editors and IDEs in current use. [Appendix C](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#515)   
directs readers to several of the most popular online resources for getting

help.[Appendix D c](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#521)ontinues to offer a mini crash course in using Git for   
version control. [Appendix E i](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#531)s brand new for the third edition. Even with   
a good set of instructions for deploying the apps you create, there are   
many things that can go wrong. This appendix offers a detailed trouble-  
shooting guide that you can use when the deployment process doesn't

**A C K N O W L E D G M E N T S**

This book would not have been possible without the wonderful and   
extremely professional staff at No Starch Press. Bill Pollock invited me to   
write an introductory book, and I deeply appreciate that original offer. Liz   
Chadwick has worked on all three editions, and the book is better because   
of her ongoing involvement. Eva Morrow brought fresh eyes to this new edi-  
tion, and her insights have improved the book as well. I appreciate Doug   
McNair's guidance in using proper grammar, without becoming overly for-  
mal. Jennifer Kepler has supervised the production work, which turns my   
many files into a polished final product.

There are many people at No Starch Press who have helped make this

book a success but whom I haven't had the chance to work with directly. No   
Starch has a fantastic marketing team, who go beyond just selling books;   
they make sure readers find the books that are likely to work well for them   
and help them reach their goals. No Starch also has a strong foreign-rights   
department. *Python Crash Course* has reached readers around the world, in   
many languages, due to the diligence of this team. To all of these people   
whom I haven't worked with individually, thank you for helping *Python
Crash Course* find its audience.

I'd like to thank Kenneth Love, the technical reviewer for all three

editions of *Python Crash Course* . I met Kenneth at PyCon one year, and   
their enthusiasm for the language and the Python community has been a   
constant source of professional inspiration ever since. Kenneth, as always,   
went beyond simple fact-checking and reviewed the book with the goal of

Acknowledgments

helping newer programmers develop a solid understanding of the Python   
language and programming in general. They also kept an eye out for areas   
that worked well enough in previous editions but could be improved upon,   
given the opportunity for a full rewrite. That said, any inaccuracies that   
remain are completely my own.

I'd also like to express my appreciation to all the readers who have

shared their experience of working through *Python Crash Course* . Learning   
the basics of programming can change your perspective on the world, and   
sometimes this has a profound impact on people. It's deeply humbling to   
hear these stories, and I appreciate everyone who has shared their experi-  
ences so openly.

I'd like to thank my father for introducing me to programming at a

young age and for not being afraid that I'd break his equipment. I'd like   
to thank my wife, Erin, for supporting and encouraging me through the   
writing of this book, and through all the work that goes into maintaining it   
through multiple editions. I'd also like to thank my son, Ever, whose curios-  
ity continues to inspire me.

Every programmer has a story about how

they learned to write their first program.

I started programming as a child, when

my father was working for Digital Equipment

Corporation, one of the pioneering companies of the   
modern computing era. I wrote my first program on a   
kit computer that my dad had assembled in our base-  
ment. The computer consisted of nothing more than

a bare motherboard connected to a keyboard without a case, and its moni-  
tor was a bare cathode ray tube. My initial program was a simple number   
guessing game, which looked something like this:

I'm thinking of a number! Try to guess the number I'm thinking of:

**25**

Too low! Guess again:

**50**

Too high! Guess again:

**42**

That's it! Would you like to play again? (yes/no)

**no**

Thanks for playing!

Introduction

I'll always remember how satisfied I felt, watching my family play a

game that I created and that worked as I intended it to.

That early experience had a lasting impact. There's real satisfaction in

building something with a purpose, that solves a problem. The software I   
write now meets more significant needs than my childhood efforts did, but   
the sense of satisfaction I get from creating a program that works is still   
largely the same.

**Who Is This Book For?**

The goal of this book is to bring you up to speed with Python as quickly as   
possible so you can build programs that work---games, data visualizations,   
and web applications---while developing a foundation in programming that   
will serve you well for the rest of your life. *Python Crash Course* is written for   
people of any age who have never programmed in Python or have never   
programmed at all. This book is for those who want to learn the basics of   
programming quickly so they can focus on interesting projects, and those   
who like to test their understanding of new concepts by solving meaningful   
problems. *Python Crash Course* is also perfect for teachers at all levels who   
want to offer their students a project-based introduction to programming.   
If you're taking a college class and want a friendlier introduction to Python   
than the text you've been assigned, this book can make your class easier as   
well. If you're looking to change careers, *Python Crash Course* can help you   
make the transition into a more satisfying career track. It has worked well   
for a wide variety of readers, with a broad range of goals.

**What Can You Expect to Learn?**

The purpose of this book is to make you a good programmer in general   
and a good Python programmer in particular. You'll learn efficiently and   
adopt good habits as you gain a solid foundation in general programming   
concepts. After working your way through *Python Crash Course* , you should   
be ready to move on to more advanced Python techniques, and your next   
programming language will be even easier to grasp.

In Part I of this book, you'll learn basic programming concepts you

need to know to write Python programs. These concepts are the same as   
those you'd learn when starting out in almost any programming language.   
You'll learn about different kinds of data and the ways you can store data in   
your programs. You'll build collections of data, such as lists and dictionar-  
ies, and you'll work through those collections in efficient ways. You'll learn   
to use

while

loops and

if

statements to test for certain conditions, so you

can run specific sections of code while those conditions are true and run   
other sections when they're not---a technique that helps you automate many   
processes.

You'll learn to accept input from users to make your programs interac-

tive, and to keep your programs running as long as the user wants. You'll   
explore how to write functions that make parts of your program reusable,  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress037.png)

Introduction

**xxxv**

so you only have to write blocks of code that perform certain actions once,   
while using that code as many times as you need. You'll then extend this   
concept to more complicated behavior with classes, making fairly simple   
programs respond to a variety of situations. You'll learn to write programs   
that handle common errors gracefully. After working through each of these   
basic concepts, you'll write a number of increasingly complex programs   
using what you've learned. Finally, you'll take your first step toward interme-  
diate programming by learning how to write tests for your code, so you can   
develop your programs further without worrying about introducing bugs.   
All the information in Part I will prepare you for taking on larger, more   
complex projects.

In Part II, you'll apply what you learned in Part I to three projects. You

can do any or all of these projects, in whichever order works best for you. In   
the first project, in Chapter[s 12--](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#265)[14, y](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#315)ou'll create a *Space Invaders* --style shoot-  
ing game called *Alien Invasion* , which includes several increasingly difficult   
levels of game play. After you've completed this project, you should be well   
on your way to being able to develop your own 2D games. Even if you don't   
aspire to become a game programmer, working through this project is an   
enjoyable way to tie together much of what you'll learn in Part I.

The second project, in Chapter[s 15--](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#339)[17](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#393), introduces you to data visualiza-

tion. Data scientists use a variety of visualization techniques to help make   
sense of the vast amount of information available to them. You'll work with   
datasets that you generate through code, datasets that you download from   
online sources, and datasets your programs download automatically. After   
you've completed this project, you'll be able to write programs that sift   
through large datasets and make visual representations of many different   
kinds of information.

In the third project, in Chapters [18--](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#411)[20, y](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#471)ou'll build a small web appli-

cation called Learning Log. This project allows you to keep an organized   
journal of information you've learned about a specific topic. You'll be able   
to keep separate logs for different topics and allow others to create an   
account and start their own journals. You'll also learn how to deploy your   
project so anyone can access it online, from anywhere in the world.

**Online Resources**

No Starch Press has more information about this book available online at   
[*https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition*](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition).

I also maintain an extensive set of supplementary resources a[t *https://*](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e)

[*ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e*](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e). These resources include the following:

**Setup instructions** The setup instructions online are identical to   
what's in the book, but they include active links you can click for all the   
different steps. If you're having any setup issues, refer to this resource.  
**Updates** Python, like all languages, is constantly evolving. I maintain   
a thorough set of updates, so if anything isn't working, check here to   
see whether instructions have changed.

Introduction

**Solutions to exercises** You should spend significant time on your own   
attempting the exercises in the "Try It Yourself" sections. However, if   
you're stuck and can't make any progress, solutions to most of the exer-  
cises are online.  
**Cheat sheets** A full set of downloadable cheat sheets for quick refer-  
ence to major concepts is also online.

**Why Python?**

Every year, I consider whether to continue using Python or move on to a   
different language, perhaps one that's newer to the programming world.   
But I continue to focus on Python for many reasons. Python is an incredibly   
efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than   
many other languages would require. Python's syntax will also help you   
write "clean" code. Your code will be easier to read, easier to debug, and   
easier to extend and build upon, compared to other languages.

People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web appli-

cations, solve business problems, and develop internal tools at all kinds of   
interesting companies. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields, for   
academic research and applied work.

One of the most important reasons I continue to use Python is because

of the Python community, which includes an incredibly diverse and wel-  
coming group of people. Community is essential to programmers because   
programming isn't a solitary pursuit. Most of us, even the most experienced   
programmers, need to ask advice from others who have already solved simi-  
lar problems. Having a well-connected and supportive community is critical   
to helping you solve problems, and the Python community is fully support-  
ive of people who are learning Python as their first programming language   
or coming to Python with a background in other languages.

Python is a great language to learn, so let's get started!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress039.png)

**PART I**

**B A S I C S**

Part I of this book teaches you the basic concepts you'll   
need to write Python programs. Many of these con-  
cepts are common to all programming languages, so   
they'll be useful throughout your life as a programmer.

In **Chapter 1** you'll install Python on your computer and run your first

program, which prints the message *Hello world!* to the screen.

In **Chapter 2** you'll learn to assign information to variables and work

with text and numerical values.

**Chapters 3** and **4** introduce lists. Lists can store as much information as

you want in one place, allowing you to work with that data efficiently. You'll   
be able to work with hundreds, thousands, and even millions of values in   
just a few lines of code.

In **Chapter 5** you'll use

if

statements to write code that responds one

way if certain conditions are true, and responds in a different way if those   
conditions are not true.

**Chapter 6** shows you how to use Python's dictionaries, which let you

make connections between different pieces of information. Like lists, dic-  
tionaries can contain as much information as you need to store.

In **Chapter 7** you'll learn how to accept input from users to make your

programs interactive. You'll also learn about

while

loops, which run blocks

of code repeatedly as long as certain conditions remain true.

In **Chapter 8** you'll write functions, which are named blocks of code

that perform a specific task and can be run whenever you need them.

**Chapter 9** introduces classes, which allow you to model real-world

objects. You'll write code that represents dogs, cats, people, cars, rockets,   
and more.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress040.png)

**2**

Part I: Basics

**Chapter 10** shows you how to work with files and handle errors so your

programs won't crash unexpectedly. You'll store data before your program   
closes and read the data back in when the program runs again. You'll learn   
about Python's exceptions, which allow you to anticipate errors and make   
your programs handle those errors gracefully.

In **Chapter 11** you'll learn to write tests for your code, to check that

your programs work the way you intend them to. As a result, you'll be able   
to expand your programs without worrying about introducing new bugs.   
Testing your code is one of the first skills that will help you transition from   
beginner to intermediate programmer.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress041.png)

**1**

**G E T T I N G S T A R T E D**

In this chapter, you'll run your first Python

program, *hello_world.py*. First, you'll need

to check whether a recent version of Python

is installed on your computer; if it isn't, you'll

install it. You'll also install a text editor to work with   
your Python programs. Text editors recognize Python   
code and highlight sections as you write, making it   
easy to understand your code's structure.

**Setting Up Your Programming Environment**

Python differs slightly on different operating systems, so you'll need to keep   
a few considerations in mind. In the following sections, we'll make sure   
Python is set up correctly on your system.

Chapter 1

***Python Versions***

Every programming language evolves as new ideas and technologies emerge,   
and the developers of Python have continually made the language more   
versatile and powerful. As of this writing, the latest version is Python 3.11,   
but everything in this book should run on Python 3.9 or later. In this sec-  
tion, we'll find out if Python is already installed on your system and whether   
you need to install a newer version[. Appendix A c](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#501)ontains additional details   
about installing the latest version of Python on each major operating system   
as well.

***Running Snippets of Python Code***

You can run Python's interpreter in a terminal window, allowing you to try   
bits of Python code without having to save and run an entire program.

Throughout this book, you'll see code snippets that look like this:

\>\>\>

**print("Hello Python interpreter!")**

Hello Python interpreter!

The three angle brackets (

\>\>\>

) prompt, which we'll refer to as a *Python*

*prompt* , indicates that you should be using the terminal window. The bold   
text is the code you should type in and then execute by pressing ENTER.   
Most of the examples in this book are small, self-contained programs that   
you'll run from your text editor rather than the terminal, because you'll   
write most of your code in the text editor. But sometimes, basic concepts   
will be shown in a series of snippets run through a Python terminal session   
to demonstrate particular concepts more efficiently. When you see three   
angle brackets in a code listing, you're looking at code and output from   
a terminal session. We'll try coding in the interpreter on your system in a   
moment.

We'll also use a text editor to create a simple program called *Hello World!*

that has become a staple of learning to program. There's a long-held tradi-  
tion in the programming world that printing the message

Hello world!

to

the screen as your first program in a new language will bring you good luck.   
Such a simple program serves a very real purpose. If it runs correctly on your   
system, then any Python program you write should work as well.

***About the VS Code Editor***

*VS Code* is a powerful, professional-quality text editor that's free and beginner-  
friendly. VS Code is great for both simple and complex projects, so if you   
become comfortable using it while learning Python, you can continue using   
it as you progress to larger and more complicated projects. VS Code can be   
installed on all modern operating systems, and it supports most programming   
languages, including Python.

[Appendix B p](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#507)rovides information on other text editors. If you're curi-

ous about the other options, you might want to skim that appendix at this

point. If you want to begin programming quickly, you can use VS Code to   
start. Then you can consider other editors, once you've gained some experi-  
ence as a programmer. In this chapter, I'll walk you through installing VS   
Code on your operating system.

**N O T E**

*If you already have a text editor installed and you know how to configure it to run*

*Python programs, you are welcome to use that editor instead.*

**Python on Different Operating Systems**

Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means it runs on   
all the major operating systems. Any Python program you write should run   
on any modern computer that has Python installed. However, the methods   
for setting up Python on different operating systems vary slightly.

In this section, you'll learn how to set up Python on your system. You'll

first check whether a recent version of Python is installed on your system,   
and install it if it's not. Then you'll install VS Code. These are the only two   
steps that are different for each operating system.

In the sections that follow, you'll run *hello_world.py* and troubleshoot

anything that doesn't work. I'll walk you through this process for each oper-  
ating system, so you'll have a Python programming environment that you   
can rely on.

***Python on Windows***

Windows doesn't usually come with Python, so you'll probably need to   
install it and then install VS Code.

**Installing Python**

First, check whether Python is installed on your system. Open a command   
window by entering

**command**

into the Start menu and clicking the **Command**

**Prompt** app. In the terminal window, enter

**python**

in lowercase. If you get a

Python prompt (

\>\>\>

) in response, Python is installed on your system. If you

see an error message telling you that

python

is not a recognized command,

or if the Microsoft store opens, Python isn't installed. Close the Microsoft   
store if it opens; it's better to download an official installer than to use   
Microsoft's version.

If Python is not installed on your system, or if you see a version

earlier than Python 3.9, you need to download a Python installer for   
Windows. Go to [*https://python.org*](https://python.org) and hover over the**Downloads** link.   
You should see a button for downloading the latest version of Python.   
Click the button, which should automatically start downloading the cor-  
rect installer for your system. After you've downloaded the file, run the   
installer. Make sure you select the option **Add Python to PATH** , which   
will make it easier to configure your system correctly. Figure 1-1 shows   
this option selected.

*tions in [Appendix A](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#501)* *.*

Enter the following line in your Python session:

\>\>\>

**print("Hello Python interpreter!")**

Hello Python interpreter!  
\>\>\>

You should see the output

Hello Python interpreter!

Anytime you want

to run a snippet of Python code, open a command window and start a   
Python terminal session. To close the terminal session, press CTRL-Z and   
then press ENTER, or enter the command

**exit()**

.

**Installing VS Code**

You can download an installer for VS Code at [*https://code.visualstudio.com*](https://code.visualstudio.com).   
Click the **Download for Windows** button and run the installer. Skip the fol-  
lowing sections about macOS and Linux, and follow the steps in "Running   
a Hello World Program" on [page 9](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#47).

***Python on macOS***

Python is not installed by default on the latest versions of macOS, so you'll   
need to install it if you haven't already done so. In this section, you'll install   
the latest version of Python, and then install VS Code and make sure it's   
configured correctly.

**N O T E**

*Python 2 was included on older versions of macOS, but it's an outdated version that*

*you shouldn't use.*

**Checking Whether Python 3 Is Installed**

Open a terminal window by going to **Applications**

4

**Utilities**

4

**Terminal**.

You can also press

â

-spacebar, type

**terminal**

, and then press ENTER. To see

if you have a recent enough version of Python installed, enter

**python3**

. You'll

most likely see a message about installing the *command line developer tools* .   
It's better to install these tools after installing Python, so if this message   
appears, cancel the pop-up window.

If the output shows you have Python 3.9 or a later version installed,

you can skip the next section and go to "Running Python in a Terminal   
Session." If you see any version earlier than Python 3.9, follow the instruc-  
tions in the next section to install the latest version.

Note that on macOS, whenever you see the

python

command in this

book, you need to use the

python3

command instead to make sure you're

using Python 3. On most macOS systems, the

python

command either points

to an outdated version of Python that should only be used by internal sys-  
tem tools, or it points to nothing and generates an error message.

**Installing the Latest Version of Python**

You can find a Python installer for your system at [*https://python.org*.](https://python.org) Hover   
over the **Download** link, and you should see a button for downloading the   
latest version of Python. Click the button, which should automatically start   
downloading the correct installer for your system. After the file downloads,   
run the installer.

After the installer runs, a Finder window should appear. Double-click

the *Install Certificates.command* file. Running this file will allow you to more   
easily install additional libraries that you'll need for real-world projects,   
including the projects in the second half of this book.

**Running Python in a Terminal Session**

You can now try running snippets of Python code by opening a new termi-  
nal window and typing

**python3**

:

), which means macOS has found the version of Python

you just installed.

Enter the following line in the terminal session:

\>\>\>

**print("Hello Python interpreter!")**

Hello Python interpreter!  
\>\>\>

You should see the message

Hello Python interpreter!

, which should

print directly in the current terminal window. You can close the Python   
interpreter by pressing CTRL-D or by entering the command

**exit()**

.

**N O T E**

*On newer macOS systems, you'll see a percent sign (*

*%*

**Installing VS Code**

To install the VS Code editor, you need to download the installer at [*https://
code.visualstudio.com*](https://code.visualstudio.com). Click the**Download** button, and then open a **Finder**   
window and go to the **Downloads** folder. Drag the **Visual Studio Code**   
installer to your Applications folder, then double-click the installer to run it.

Skip over the following section about Python on Linux, and follow the

steps in "Running a Hello World Program" o[n page 9](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#47).

***Python on Linux***

Linux systems are designed for programming, so Python is already installed   
on most Linux computers. The people who write and maintain Linux expect   
you to do your own programming at some point, and encourage you to   
do so. For this reason, there's very little to install and only a few settings to   
change to start programming.

**Checking Your Version of Python**

Open a terminal window by running the Terminal application on your   
system (in Ubuntu, you can press CTRL-ALT-T). To find out which ver-  
sion of Python is installed, enter

**python3**

with a lowercase *p*. When Python

is installed, this command starts the Python interpreter. You should see   
output indicating which version of Python is installed. You should also see   
a Python prompt (

\>\>\>

) where you can start entering Python commands:

$

**python3**

Python 3.10.4 (main, Apr . . . , 09:04:19) \[GCC 11.2.0\] on linux  
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  
\>\>\>

This output indicates that Python 3.10.4 is currently the default ver-

sion of Python installed on this computer. When you've seen this output,   
press CTRL-D or enter

**exit()**

to leave the Python prompt and return to a  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress047.png)

Getting Started

terminal prompt. Whenever you see the

python

command in this book, enter

**python3**

instead.

You'll need Python 3.9 or later to run the code in this book. If the

Python version installed on your system is earlier than Python 3.9, or if you   
want to update to the latest version currently available, refer to the instruc-  
tions in [Appendix A.](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#501)

**Running Python in a Terminal Session**

You can try running snippets of Python code by opening a terminal and enter-  
ing

**python3**

, as you did when checking your version. Do this again, and when

you have Python running, enter the following line in the terminal session:

\>\>\>

**print("Hello Python interpreter!")**

Hello Python interpreter!  
\>\>\>

The message should print directly in the current terminal window.

Remember that you can close the Python interpreter by pressing CTRL-D   
or by entering the command

**exit()**

.

**Installing VS Code**

On Ubuntu Linux, you can install VS Code from the Ubuntu Software   
Center. Click the Ubuntu Software icon in your menu and search for *vscode* .   
Click the app called **Visual Studio Code** (sometimes called *code* ), and then   
click **Install** . Once it's installed, search your system for *VS Code* and launch   
the app.

**Running a Hello World Program**

With a recent version of Python and VS Code installed, you're almost ready   
to run your first Python program written in a text editor. But before doing   
so, you need to install the Python extension for VS Code.

***Installing the Python Extension for VS Code***

VS Code works with many different programming languages; to get the   
most out of it as a Python programmer, you'll need to install the Python   
extension. This extension adds support for writing, editing, and running   
Python programs.

To install the Python extension, click the Manage icon, which looks

like a gear in the lower-left corner of the VS Code app. In the menu that   
appears, click **Extensions**. Enter

**python**

in the search box and click the

**Python** extension. (If you see more than one extension named *Python* ,   
choose the one supplied by Microsoft.) Click **Install** and install any addi-  
tional tools that your system needs to complete the installation. If you see   
a message that you need to install Python, and you've already done so, you   
can ignore this message.

*If you're using macOS and a pop-up asks you to install the*command line devel-

oper tools*, click **Install** . You may see a message that it will take an excessively long
time to install, but it should only take about 10 or 20 minutes on a reasonable inter-
net connection.*

***Running hello_world.py***

Before you write your first program, make a folder called *python_work* on   
your desktop for your projects. It's best to use lowercase letters and under-  
scores for spaces in file and folder names, because Python uses these   
naming conventions. You can make this folder somewhere other than   
the desktop, but it will be easier to follow some later steps if you save the   
*python_work* folder directly on your desktop.

Open VS Code, and close the **Get Started** tab if it's still open. Make a

new file by clicking **File**

4

**New File** or pressing CTRL-N (

â

-N on macOS).

Save the file as *hello_world.py* in your *python_work* folder. The extension *.py*   
tells VS Code that your file is written in Python, and tells it how to run the   
program and highlight the text in a helpful way.

After you've saved your file, enter the following line in the editor:

*hello_world.py*

print("Hello Python world!")

To run your program, select **Run**

4

**Run Without Debugging** or press

CTRL-F5. A terminal screen should appear at the bottom of the VS Code   
window, showing your program's output:

Hello Python world!

You'll likely see some additional output showing the Python interpreter

that was used to run your program. If you want to simplify the information   
that's displayed so you only see your program's output, see [Appendix B. Y](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#507)ou   
can also find helpful suggestions about how to use VS Code more efficiently   
i[n Appendix B](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#507).

If you don't see this output, something might have gone wrong in the

program. Check every character on the line you entered. Did you acciden-  
tally capitalize

print

? Did you forget one or both of the quotation marks or

parentheses? Programming languages expect very specific syntax, and if   
you don't provide that, you'll get errors. If you can't get the program to   
run, see the suggestions in the next section.

**Troubleshooting**

If you can't get *hello_world.py* to run, here are a few remedies you can try   
that are also good general solutions for any programming problem:

â¢

When a program contains a significant error, Python displays a *traceback* ,   
which is an error report. Python looks through the file and tries to iden-  
tify the problem. Check the traceback; it might give you a clue as to what   
issue is preventing the program from running.

Getting Started

**11**

â¢

Step away from your computer, take a short break, and then try again.   
Remember that syntax is very important in programming, so something   
as simple as mismatched quotation marks or mismatched parentheses   
can prevent a program from running properly. Reread the relevant   
parts of this chapter, look over your code, and try to find the mistake.

â¢

Start over again. You probably don't need to uninstall any software, but   
it might make sense to delete your *hello_world.py* file and re-create it   
from scratch.

â¢

Ask someone else to follow the steps in this chapter, on your computer   
or a different one, and watch what they do carefully. You might have   
missed one small step that someone else happens to catch.

â¢

See the additional installation instructions in [Appendix A](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#501); some of the   
details included in the Appendix may help you solve your issue.

â¢

Find someone who knows Python and ask them to help you get set up.   
If you ask around, you might find that you unexpectedly know someone   
who uses Python.

â¢

The setup instructions in this chapter are also available through this   
book's companion website at [*https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e*.](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e) The   
online version of these instructions might work better because you can   
simply cut and paste code and click links to the resources you need.

â¢

Ask for help online[. Appendix C](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#515) provides a number of resources, such   
as forums and live chat sites, where you can ask for solutions from peo-  
ple who've already worked through the issue you're currently facing.

Never worry that you're bothering experienced programmers. Every

programmer has been stuck at some point, and most programmers are   
happy to help you set up your system correctly. As long as you can state   
clearly what you're trying to do, what you've already tried, and the results   
you're getting, there's a good chance someone will be able to help you. As   
mentioned in the [introduction](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#35), the Python community is very friendly and   
welcoming to beginners.

Python should run well on any modern computer. Early setup issues

can be frustrating, but they're well worth sorting out. Once you get *hello
_world.py* running, you can start to learn Python, and your programming   
work will become more interesting and satisfying.

**Running Python Programs from a Terminal**

You'll run most of your programs directly in your text editor. However,   
sometimes it's useful to run programs from a terminal instead. For   
example, you might want to run an existing program without opening   
it for editing.

You can do this on any system with Python installed if you know how

to access the directory where the program file is stored. To try this, make   
sure you've saved the *hello_world.py* file in the *python_work* folder on your   
desktop.

Chapter 1

***On Windows***

You can use the terminal command

cd

, for *change directory*, to navigate through

your filesystem in a command window. The command

dir

, for *directory*, shows

you all the files that exist in the current directory.

Open a new terminal window and enter the following commands to

run *hello_world.py*:

C:\\\>

**cd Desktop\\python_work**

C:\\Desktop\\python_work\>

**dir**

hello_world.py  
C:\\Desktop\\python_work\>

**python hello_world.py**

Hello Python world!

First, use the

**cd**

command to navigate to the *python_work* folder, which is

in the*Desktop* folder. Next, use the

**dir**

command to make sure *hello_world.py*

is in this folder. Then run the file using the command

**python hello_world.py**

.

Most of your programs will run fine directly from your editor. However,

as your work becomes more complex, you'll want to run some of your pro-  
grams from a terminal.

***On macOS and Linux***

Running a Python program from a terminal session is the same on Linux   
and macOS. You can use the terminal command

cd

, for *change directory*, to

navigate through your filesystem in a terminal session. The command

ls

,

for *list*, shows you all the nonhidden files that exist in the current directory.

Open a new terminal window and enter the following commands to

run *hello_world.py*:

\~$

**cd Desktop/python_work/**

\~/Desktop/python_work$

**ls**

hello_world.py  
\~/Desktop/python_work$

**python3 hello_world.py**

Hello Python world!

First, use the

**cd**

command to navigate to the *python_work* folder, which is

in the *Desktop* folder. Next, use the

**ls**

command to make sure *hello_world.py* is

in this folder. Then run the file using the command

**python3 hello_world.py**

.

Most of your programs will run fine directly from your editor. But as

your work becomes more complex, you'll want to run some of your pro-  
grams from a terminal.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

The exercises in this chapter are exploratory in nature. Starting in [Chapter 2](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#53),   
the challenges you'll solve will be based on what you've learned.

**1-1. python.org:**

Explore the Python home pag[e (](https://python.org)

[*https://python.org*](https://python.org)

) to find top-

ics that interest you. As you become familiar with Python, different parts of the   
site will be more useful to you.

**1-2. Hello World Typos:**

Open the

*hello_world.py*

file you just created. Make a

typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. Can you make a typo   
that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you   
make a typo that doesn't generate an error? Why do you think it didn't make   
an error?

**1-3. Infinite Skills:**

If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build?

You're about to learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind, you'll   
have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to write brief   
descriptions of what you want to create. It's a good habit to keep an "ideas"   
notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take   
a few minutes now to describe three programs you want to create.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed   
Python on your system if it wasn't already there. You also installed a text edi-  
tor to make it easier to write Python code. You ran snippets of Python code   
in a terminal session, and you ran your first program, *hello_world.py* . You   
probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.

In the next chapter, you'll learn about the different kinds of data you can

work with in your Python programs, and you'll start to use variables as well.

In this chapter you'll learn about the dif-

ferent kinds of data you can work with in

your Python programs. You'll also learn

how to use variables to represent data in your

programs.

**What Really Happens When You Run hello_world.py**

Let's take a closer look at what Python does when you run *hello_world.py* . As   
it turns out, Python does a fair amount of work, even when it runs a simple   
program:

*hello_world.py*

print("Hello Python world!")

When you run this code, you should see the following output:

Hello Python world!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress054.png)

**16**

Chapter 2

When you run the file *hello_world.py* , the ending *.py* indicates that the

file is a Python program. Your editor then runs the file through the *Python
interpreter* , which reads through the program and determines what each word   
in the program means. For example, when the interpreter sees the word

print

followed by parentheses, it prints to the screen whatever is inside the

parentheses.

As you write your programs, your editor highlights different parts of

your program in different ways. For example, it recognizes that

print()

is

the name of a function and displays that word in one color. It recognizes   
that

"Hello Python world!"

is not Python code, and displays that phrase in a

different color. This feature is called *syntax highlighting* and is quite useful   
as you start to write your own programs.

**Variables**

Let's try using a variable in *hello_world.py* . Add a new line at the beginning   
of the file, and modify the second line:

*hello_world.py*

message = "Hello Python world!"  
print(message)

Run this program to see what happens. You should see the same output

you saw previously:

Hello Python world!

We've added a *variable* named

message

. Every variable is connected to a

*value* , which is the information associated with that variable. In this case   
the value is the

"Hello Python world!"

text.

Adding a variable makes a little more work for the Python interpreter.

When it processes the first line, it associates the variable

message

with the

"Hello Python world!"

text. When it reaches the second line, it prints the

value associated with

message

to the screen.

Let's expand on this program by modifying *hello_world.py* to print a sec-

ond message. Add a blank line to *hello_world.py* , and then add two new lines   
of code:

message = "Hello Python world!"  
print(message)

message = "Hello Python Crash Course world!"  
print(message)

Now when you run *hello_world.py*, you should see two lines of output:

Hello Python world!  
Hello Python Crash Course world!

You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time,

and Python will always keep track of its current value.

Variables and Simple Data Types

**17**

***Naming and Using Variables***

When you're using variables in Python, you need to adhere to a few rules   
and guidelines. Breaking some of these rules will cause errors; other guide-  
lines just help you write code that's easier to read and understand. Be sure   
to keep the following rules in mind when working with variables:

â¢

Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.   
They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.   
For instance, you can call a variable

message_1

but not

1_message

.

â¢

Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used   
to separate words in variable names. For example,

greeting_message

works

but

greeting message

will cause errors.

â¢

Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.   
For example, do not use the word

print

as a variable name; Python

has reserved it for a particular programmatic purpose. (See "Python   
Keywords and Built-in Functions" on [page 466](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#504).)

â¢

Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example,

name

is

better than

n

,

student_name

is better than

s_n

, and

name_length

is better

than

length_of_persons_name

.

â¢

Be careful when using the lowercase letter *l* and the uppercase letter *O*   
because they could be confused with the numbers *1* and *0*.

It can take some practice to learn how to create good variable names,

especially as your programs become more interesting and complicated.   
As you write more programs and start to read through other people's code,   
you'll get better at coming up with meaningful names.

**N O T E**

*The Python variables you're using at this point should be lowercase. You won't get*

*errors if you use uppercase letters, but uppercase letters in variable names have spe-
cial meanings that we'll discuss in later chapters.*

***Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables***

Every programmer makes mistakes, and most make mistakes every day.   
Although good programmers might create errors, they also know how to   
respond to those errors efficiently. Let's look at an error you're likely to   
make early on and learn how to fix it.

We'll write some code that generates an error on purpose. Enter the fol-

lowing code, including the misspelled word

mesage

*,* which is shown in bold:

message = "Hello Python Crash Course reader!"  
print(

**mesage**

)

When an error occurs in your program, the Python interpreter does its

best to help you figure out where the problem is. The interpreter provides   
a traceback when a program cannot run successfully. A *traceback* is a record   
of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress056.png)

**18**

Chapter 2

Here's an example of the traceback that Python provides after you've acci-  
dentally misspelled a variable's name:

Traceback (most recent call last):

1

File "hello_world.py", line 2, in \<module\>

2

print(mesage)

\^\^\^\^\^\^

3

NameError: name 'mesage' is not defined. Did you mean: 'message'?

The output reports that an error occurs in line 2 of the file *hello_world.py*

1

.

The interpreter shows this line

2

to help us spot the error quickly and

tells us what kind of error it found

3

. In this case it found a *name error*

and reports that the variable being printed,

mesage

, has not been defined.

Python can't identify the variable name provided. A name error usually   
means we either forgot to set a variable's value before using it, or we made a   
spelling mistake when entering the variable's name. If Python finds a vari-  
able name that's similar to the one it doesn't recognize, it will ask if that's   
the name you meant to use.

In this example we omitted the letter *s* in the variable name

message

in

the second line. The Python interpreter doesn't spellcheck your code, but   
it does ensure that variable names are spelled consistently. For example,   
watch what happens when we spell *message* incorrectly in the line that   
defines the variable:

mesage = "Hello Python Crash Course reader!"

print(mesage)

In this case, the program runs successfully!

Hello Python Crash Course reader!

The variable names match, so Python sees no issue. Programming lan-

guages are strict, but they disregard good and bad spelling. As a result, you   
don't need to consider English spelling and grammar rules when you're try-  
ing to create variable names and writing code.

Many programming errors are simple, single-character typos in one

line of a program. If you find yourself spending a long time searching for   
one of these errors, know that you're in good company. Many experienced   
and talented programmers spend hours hunting down these kinds of tiny   
errors. Try to laugh about it and move on, knowing it will happen frequently   
throughout your programming life.

***Variables Are Labels***

Variables are often described as boxes you can store values in. This idea can   
be helpful the first few times you use a variable, but it isn't an accurate way   
to describe how variables are represented internally in Python. It's much   
better to think of variables as labels that you can assign to values. You can   
also say that a variable references a certain value.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress057.png)

Variables and Simple Data Types

**19**

This distinction probably won't matter much in your initial programs,

but it's worth learning earlier rather than later. At some point, you'll see   
unexpected behavior from a variable, and an accurate understanding of   
how variables work will help you identify what's happening in your code.

**N O T E**

*The best way to understand new programming concepts is to try using them in your*

*programs. If you get stuck while working on an exercise in this book, try doing some-
thing else for a while. If you're still stuck, review the relevant part of that chapter. If
you still need help, see the suggestions in [Appendix C](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#515)* *.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises. Save each pro-  
gram with a filename that follows standard Python conventions, using lowercase   
letters and underscores, such as

*simple_message.py*

and

*simple_messages.py*

.

**2-1. Simple Message:**

Assign a message to a variable, and then print that

message.

**2-2. Simple Messages:**

Assign a message to a variable, and print that message.

Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new   
message.

**Strings**

Because most programs define and gather some sort of data and then do   
something useful with it, it helps to classify different types of data. The first   
data type we'll look at is the string. Strings are quite simple at first glance,   
but you can use them in many different ways.

A *string* is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered

a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your   
strings like this:

"This is a string."  
'This is also a string.'

This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your

strings:

'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'  
"The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."  
"One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."

Let's explore some of the ways you can use strings.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress058.png)

**20**

Chapter 2

***Changing Case in a String with Methods***

One of the simplest tasks you can do with strings is change the case of the   
words in a string. Look at the following code, and try to determine what's   
happening:

*name.py*

name = "ada lovelace"  
print(name.title())

Save this file as *name.py* and then run it. You should see this output:

Ada Lovelace

In this example, the variable

name

refers to the lowercase string

"ada

lovelace"

. The method

title()

appears after the variable in the

print()

call. A

*method* is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot (

.

)

after

name

in

name.title()

tells Python to make the

title()

method act on

the variable

name

. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because

methods often need additional information to do their work. That informa-  
tion is provided inside the parentheses. The

title()

function doesn't need

any additional information, so its parentheses are empty.

The

title()

method changes each word to title case, where each word

begins with a capital letter. This is useful because you'll often want to think   
of a name as a piece of information. For example, you might want your pro-  
gram to recognize the input values

Ada

,

ADA

, and

ada

as the same name, and

display all of them as

Ada

.

Several other useful methods are available for dealing with case as well.

For example, you can change a string to all uppercase or all lowercase let-  
ters like this:

name = "Ada Lovelace"  
print(name.upper())  
print(name.lower())

This will display the following:

ADA LOVELACE  
ada lovelace

The

lower()

method is particularly useful for storing data. You typi-

cally won't want to trust the capitalization that your users provide, so you'll   
convert strings to lowercase before storing them. Then when you want to   
display the information, you'll use the case that makes the most sense for   
each string.

***Using Variables in Strings***

In some situations, you'll want to use a variable's value inside a string. For   
example, you might want to use two variables to represent a first name and  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress059.png)

Variables and Simple Data Types

**21**

a last name, respectively, and then combine those values to display some-  
one's full name:

*full_name.py*

first_name = "ada"  
last_name = "lovelace"

1

full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"

print(full_name)

To insert a variable's value into a string, place the letter

f

immediately

before the opening quotation mark

1

. Put braces around the name or

names of any variable you want to use inside the string. Python will replace   
each variable with its value when the string is displayed.

These strings are called *f-strings* . The *f* is for *format*, because Python

formats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its   
value. The output from the previous code is:

ada lovelace

You can do a lot with f-strings. For example, you can use f-strings to

compose complete messages using the information associated with a vari-  
able, as shown here:

first_name = "ada"  
last_name = "lovelace"  
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"

1

print(f"Hello, {full_name.title()}!")

The full name is used in a sentence that greets the user

1

, and the

title()

method changes the name to title case. This code returns a simple

but nicely formatted greeting:

Hello, Ada Lovelace!

You can also use f-strings to compose a message, and then assign the

entire message to a variable:

first_name = "ada"  
last_name = "lovelace"  
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"

1

message = f"Hello, {full_name.title()}!"

2

print(message)

This code displays the message

Hello, Ada Lovelace!

as well, but by

assigning the message to a variable

1

we make the final

print()

call much

simpler

2

.

***Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines***

In programming, *whitespace* refers to any nonprinting characters, such as   
spaces, tabs, and end-of-line symbols. You can use whitespace to organize   
your output so it's easier for users to read.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress060.png)

Chapter 2

To add a tab to your text, use the character combination

\\t

:

\>\>\>

**print("Python")**

Python  
\>\>\>

**print("\\tPython")**

Python

To add a newline in a string, use the character combination

\\n

:

\>\>\>

**print("Languages:\\nPython\\nC\\nJavaScript")**

Languages:  
Python  
C  
JavaScript

You can also combine tabs and newlines in a single string. The string

"\\n\\t"

tells Python to move to a new line, and start the next line with a tab.

The following example shows how you can use a one-line string to generate   
four lines of output:

\>\>\>

**print("Languages:\\n\\tPython\\n\\tC\\n\\tJavaScript")**

Languages:  
Python  
C  
JavaScript

Newlines and tabs will be very useful in the next two chapters, when

you start to produce many lines of output from just a few lines of code.

***Stripping Whitespace***

Extra whitespace can be confusing in your programs. To programmers,

'python'

and

'python '

look pretty much the same. But to a program, they

are two different strings. Python detects the extra space in

'python '

and

considers it significant unless you tell it otherwise.

It's important to think about whitespace, because often you'll want to

compare two strings to determine whether they are the same. For example,   
one important instance might involve checking people's usernames when   
they log in to a website. Extra whitespace can be confusing in much sim-  
pler situations as well. Fortunately, Python makes it easy to eliminate extra   
whitespace from data that people enter.

Python can look for extra whitespace on the right and left sides of a

string. To ensure that no whitespace exists at the right side of a string, use   
the

rstrip()

method:

1

\>\>\>

**favorite_language = 'python '**

2

\>\>\>

**favorite_language**

'python '

3

\>\>\>

**favorite_language.rstrip()**

'python'

4

\>\>\>

**favorite_language**

'python '  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress061.png)

Variables and Simple Data Types

**23**

The value associated with

favorite_language

1

contains extra whitespace

at the end of the string. When you ask Python for this value in a termi-  
nal session, you can see the space at the end of the value

2

. When the

rstrip()

method acts on the variable

favorite_language

3

, this extra space is

removed. However, it is only removed temporarily. If you ask for the value   
of

favorite_language

again, the string looks the same as when it was entered,

including the extra whitespace

4

.

To remove the whitespace from the string permanently, you have to

associate the stripped value with the variable name:

\>\>\>

**favorite_language = 'python '**

1

\>\>\>

**favorite_language = favorite_language.rstrip()**

\>\>\>

**favorite_language**

'python'

To remove the whitespace from the string, you strip the whitespace

from the right side of the string and then associate this new value with   
the original variable

1

. Changing a variable's value is done often in pro-

gramming. This is how a variable's value can be updated as a program is   
executed or in response to user input.

You can also strip whitespace from the left side of a string using the

lstrip()

method, or from both sides at once using

strip()

:

1

\>\>\>

**favorite_language = ' python '**

2

\>\>\>

**favorite_language.rstrip()**

' python'

3

\>\>\>

**favorite_language.lstrip()**

'python '

4

\>\>\>

**favorite_language.strip()**

'python'

In this example, we start with a value that has whitespace at the begin-

ning and the end

1

. We then remove the extra space from the right side

2

,

from the left side

3

, and from both sides

4

. Experimenting with these strip-

ping functions can help you become familiar with manipulating strings. In   
the real world, these stripping functions are used most often to clean up   
user input before it's stored in a program.

***Removing Prefixes***

When working with strings, another common task is to remove a prefix.   
Consider a URL with the common prefix *https://* . We want to remove this   
prefix, so we can focus on just the part of the URL that users need to enter   
into an address bar. Here's how to do that:

\>\>\> nostarch_url = 'https://nostarch.com'  
\>\>\> nostarch_url.removeprefix('https://')  
'nostarch.com'  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress062.png)

**24**

Chapter 2

Enter the name of the variable followed by a dot, and then the method

removeprefix()

. Inside the parentheses, enter the prefix you want to remove

from the original string.

Like the methods for removing whitespace,

removeprefix()

leaves the

original string unchanged. If you want to keep the new value with the pre-  
fix removed, either reassign it to the original variable or assign it to a new   
variable:

\>\>\> simple_url = nostarch_url.removeprefix('https://')

When you see a URL in an address bar and the *https://* part isn't shown,

the browser is probably using a method like

removeprefix()

behind the

scenes.

***Avoiding Syntax Errors with Strings***

One kind of error that you might see with some regularity is a syntax error.   
A *syntax error* occurs when Python doesn't recognize a section of your pro-  
gram as valid Python code. For example, if you use an apostrophe within   
single quotes, you'll produce an error. This happens because Python inter-  
prets everything between the first single quote and the apostrophe as a   
string. It then tries to interpret the rest of the text as Python code, which   
causes errors.

Here's how to use single and double quotes correctly. Save this program

as *apostrophe.py* and then run it:

*apostrophe.py*

message = "One of Python's strengths is its diverse community."  
print(message)

The apostrophe appears inside a set of double quotes, so the Python

interpreter has no trouble reading the string correctly:

One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.

However, if you use single quotes, Python can't identify where the string

should end:

message = 'One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.'

print(message)

You'll see the following output:

File "apostrophe.py", line 1  
message = 'One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.'  

1

\^

SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)

In the output you can see that the error occurs right after the final single

quote

1

. This syntax error indicates that the interpreter doesn't recognize  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress063.png)

Variables and Simple Data Types

**25**

something in the code as valid Python code, and it thinks the problem might   
be a string that's not quoted correctly. Errors can come from a variety of   
sources, and I'll point out some common ones as they arise. You might see   
syntax errors often as you learn to write proper Python code. Syntax errors   
are also the least specific kind of error, so they can be difficult and frustrat-  
ing to identify and correct. If you get stuck on a particularly stubborn error,   
see the suggestions i[n Appendix C.](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#515)

**N O T E**

*Your editor's syntax highlighting feature should help you spot some syntax errors*

*quickly as you write your programs. If you see Python code highlighted as if it's
English or English highlighted as if it's Python code, you probably have a mismatched
quotation mark somewhere in your file.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

Save each of the following exercises as a separate file, with a name like

*name*

*_cases.py*

. If you get stuck, take a break or see the suggestions in [Appendix C](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#515).

**2-3. Personal Message:**

Use a variable to represent a person's name, and print

a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, "Hello Eric,   
would you like to learn some Python today?"

**2-4. Name Cases:**

Use a variable to represent a person's name, and then print

that person's name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.

**2-5. Famous Quote:**

Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the

quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the   
following, including the quotation marks:

*Albert Einstein once said, "A person who never made a mistake never
tried anything new."*

**2-6. Famous Quote 2:**

Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the famous

person's name using a variable called

famous_person

. Then compose your mes-

sage and represent it with a new variable called

message

. Print your message.

**2-7. Stripping Names:**

Use a variable to represent a person's name, and

include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.   
Make sure you use each character combination,

"\\t"

and

"\\n"

, at least once.

Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.

Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions,

lstrip()

,

rstrip()

, and

strip()

.

**2-8. File Extensions:**

Python has a

removesuffix()

method that works exactly

like

removeprefix()

. Assign the value

'python_notes.txt'

to a variable called

filename

. Then use the

removesuffix()

method to display the filename without

the file extension, like some file browsers do.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress064.png)

**26**

Chapter 2

**Numbers**

Numbers are used quite often in programming to keep score in games,   
represent data in visualizations, store information in web applications, and   
so on. Python treats numbers in several different ways, depending on how   
they're being used. Let's first look at how Python manages integers, because   
they're the simplest to work with.

***Integers***

You can add (

+

), subtract (

-

), multiply (

\*

), and divide (

/

) integers in Python.

\>\>\>

**2 + 3**

5  
\>\>\>

**3 - 2**

1  
\>\>\>

**2 \* 3**

6  
\>\>\>

**3 / 2**

1.5

In a terminal session, Python simply returns the result of the operation.

Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents:

\>\>\>

**3 \*\* 2**

9  
\>\>\>

**3 \*\* 3**

27  
\>\>\>

**10 \*\* 6**

1000000

Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple

operations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the   
order of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order   
you specify. For example:

\>\>\>

**2 + 3\*4**

14  
\>\>\>

**(2 + 3) \* 4**

20

The spacing in these examples has no effect on how Python evaluates

the expressions; it simply helps you more quickly spot the operations that   
have priority when you're reading through the code.

***Floats***

Python calls any number with a decimal point a *float* . This term is used in   
most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress065.png)

Variables and Simple Data Types

**27**

can appear at any position in a number. Every programming language must   
be carefully designed to properly manage decimal numbers so numbers   
behave appropriately, no matter where the decimal point appears.

For the most part, you can use floats without worrying about how they

behave. Simply enter the numbers you want to use, and Python will most   
likely do what you expect:

\>\>\>

**0.1 + 0.1**

0.2  
\>\>\>

**0.2 + 0.2**

0.4  
\>\>\>

**2 \* 0.1**

0.2  
\>\>\>

**2 \* 0.2**

0.4

However, be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number of

decimal places in your answer:

\>\>\>

**0.2 + 0.1**

0.30000000000000004  
\>\>\>

**3 \* 0.1**

0.30000000000000004

This happens in all languages and is of little concern. Python tries to

find a way to represent the result as precisely as possible, which is sometimes   
difficult given how computers have to represent numbers internally. Just   
ignore the extra decimal places for now; you'll learn ways to deal with the   
extra places when you need to in the projects in [Part II](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#263).

***Integers and Floats***

When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a   
whole number, you'll always get a float:

\>\>\>

**4/2**

2.0

If you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you'll get a

float as well:

\>\>\>

**1 + 2.0**

3.0  
\>\>\>

**2 \* 3.0**

6.0  
\>\>\>

**3.0 \*\* 2**

9.0  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress066.png)

**28**

Chapter 2

Python defaults to a float in any operation that uses a float, even if the

output is a whole number.

***Underscores in Numbers***

When you're writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores   
to make large numbers more readable:

\>\>\>

**universe_age = 14_000_000_000**

When you print a number that was defined using underscores, Python

prints only the digits:

\>\>\>

**print(universe_age)**

14000000000

Python ignores the underscores when storing these kinds of values.

Even if you don't group the digits in threes, the value will still be unaf-  
fected. To Python,

1000

is the same as

1_000

, which is the same as

10_00

. This

feature works for both integers and floats.

***Multiple Assignment***

You can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line of   
code. This can help shorten your programs and make them easier to read;   
you'll use this technique most often when initializing a set of numbers.

For example, here's how you can initialize the variables

x

,

y

, and

z

to zero:

\>\>\>

**x, y, z = 0, 0, 0**

You need to separate the variable names with commas, and do the same

with the values, and Python will assign each value to its respective variable.   
As long as the number of values matches the number of variables, Python   
will match them up correctly.

***Constants***

A *constant* is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a   
program. Python doesn't have built-in constant types, but Python program-  
mers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a con-  
stant and never be changed:

MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000

When you want to treat a variable as a constant in your code, write the

name of the variable in all capital letters.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress067.png)

Variables and Simple Data Types

**29**

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**2-9. Number Eight:**

Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations   
in

print()

calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:

print(5+3)

Your output should be four lines, with the number 8 appearing once on

each line.

**2-10. Favorite Number:**

Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then,

using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print   
that message.

**Comments**

Comments are an extremely useful feature in most programming lan-  
guages. Everything you've written in your programs so far is Python code.   
As your programs become longer and more complicated, you should add   
notes within your programs that describe your overall approach to the   
problem you're solving. A *comment* allows you to write notes in your spoken   
language, within your programs.

***How Do You Write Comments?***

In Python, the hash mark (

#

) indicates a comment. Anything following a

hash mark in your code is ignored by the Python interpreter. For example:

*comment.py*

# Say hello to everyone.  
print("Hello Python people!")

Python ignores the first line and executes the second line.

Hello Python people!

***What Kinds of Comments Should You Write?***

The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is sup-  
posed to do and how you are making it work. When you're in the middle   
of working on a project, you understand how all of the pieces fit together.   
But when you return to a project after some time away, you'll likely have  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress068.png)

**30**

Chapter 2

forgotten some of the details. You can always study your code for a while   
and figure out how segments were supposed to work, but writing good com-  
ments can save you time by summarizing your overall approach clearly.

If you want to become a professional programmer or collaborate with

other programmers, you should write meaningful comments. Today, most   
software is written collaboratively, whether by a group of employees at one   
company or a group of people working together on an open source project.   
Skilled programmers expect to see comments in code, so it's best to start   
adding descriptive comments to your programs now. Writing clear, concise   
comments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as   
a new programmer.

When you're deciding whether to write a comment, ask yourself if you

had to consider several approaches before coming up with a reasonable way   
to make something work; if so, write a comment about your solution. It's   
much easier to delete extra comments later than to go back and write com-  
ments for a sparsely commented program. From now on, I'll use comments   
in examples throughout this book to help explain sections of code.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**2-11. Adding Comments:**

Choose two of the programs you've written, and

add at least one comment to each. If you don't have anything specific to write   
because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the   
current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing   
what the program does.

**The Zen of Python**

Experienced Python programmers will encourage you to avoid complexity   
and aim for simplicity whenever possible. The Python community's philoso-  
phy is contained in "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters. You can access this   
brief set of principles for writing good Python code by entering

import this

into your interpreter. I won't reproduce the entire "Zen of Python" here, but   
I'll share a few lines to help you understand why they should be important   
to you as a beginning Python programmer.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters  
Beautiful is better than ugly.

Python programmers embrace the notion that code can be beautiful

and elegant. In programming, people solve problems. Programmers have   
always respected well-designed, efficient, and even beautiful solutions to   
problems. As you learn more about Python and use it to write more code,  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress069.png)

Variables and Simple Data Types

**31**

someone might look over your shoulder one day and say, "Wow, that's some   
beautiful code!"

Simple is better than complex.

If you have a choice between a simple and a complex solution, and both

work, use the simple solution. Your code will be easier to maintain, and it   
will be easier for you and others to build on that code later on.

Complex is better than complicated.

Real life is messy, and sometimes a simple solution to a problem is unat-

tainable. In that case, use the simplest solution that works.

Readability counts.

Even when your code is complex, aim to make it readable. When you're

working on a project that involves complex coding, focus on writing infor-  
mative comments for that code.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

If two Python programmers are asked to solve the same problem, they

should come up with fairly compatible solutions. This is not to say there's   
no room for creativity in programming. On the contrary, there is plenty of   
room for creativity! However, much of programming consists of using small,   
common approaches to simple situations within a larger, more creative   
project. The nuts and bolts of your programs should make sense to other   
Python programmers.

Now is better than never.

You could spend the rest of your life learning all the intricacies of

Python and of programming in general, but then you'd never complete any   
projects. Don't try to write perfect code; write code that works, and then   
decide whether to improve your code for that project or move on to some-  
thing new.

As you continue to the next chapter and start digging into more

involved topics, try to keep this philosophy of simplicity and clarity in mind.   
Experienced programmers will respect your code more and will be happy to   
give you feedback and collaborate with you on interesting projects.

Chapter 2

**Summary**

In this chapter you learned how to work with variables. You learned to use   
descriptive variable names and resolve name errors and syntax errors when   
they arise. You learned what strings are and how to display them using low-  
ercase, uppercase, and title case. You started using whitespace to organize   
output neatly, and you learned how to remove unneeded elements from a   
string. You started working with integers and floats, and you learned some   
of the ways you can work with numerical data. You also learned to write   
explanatory comments to make your code easier for you and others to read.   
Finally, you read about the philosophy of keeping your code as simple as   
possible, whenever possible.

In [Chapter 3, y](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#71)ou'll learn how to store collections of information in

data structures called *lists* . You'll also learn how to work through a list,   
manipulating any information in that list.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress071.png)

**I N T R O D U C I N G L I S T S**

In this chapter and the next you'll learn

what lists are and how to start working with

the elements in a list. Lists allow you to store

sets of information in one place, whether you

have just a few items or millions of items. Lists are   
one of Python's most powerful features readily acces-  
sible to new programmers, and they tie together many   
important concepts in programming.

**What Is a List?**

A *list* is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that   
includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0 to 9, or the names of   
all the people in your family. You can put anything you want into a list, and   
the items in your list don't have to be related in any particular way. Because  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress072.png)

**34**

Chapter 3

a list usually contains more than one element, it's a good idea to make the   
name of your list plural, such as

letters

,

digits

, or

names

.

In Python, square brackets (

\[\]

) indicate a list, and individual elements

in the list are separated by commas. Here's a simple example of a list that   
contains a few kinds of bicycles:

*bicycles.py*

bicycles = \['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'\]  
print(bicycles)

If you ask Python to print a list, Python returns its representation of the

list, including the square brackets:

\['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'\]

Because this isn't the output you want your users to see, let's learn how

to access the individual items in a list.

***Accessing Elements in a List***

Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by   
telling Python the position, or*index* , of the item desired. To access an ele-  
ment in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item   
enclosed in square brackets.

For example, let's pull out the first bicycle in the list

bicycles

:

bicycles = \['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'\]

print(bicycles\[0\])

When we ask for a single item from a list, Python returns just that ele-

ment without square brackets:

trek

This is the result you want your users to see: clean, neatly formatted

output.

You can also use the string methods fro[m Chapter 2 o](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#53)n any element in

this list. For example, you can format the element

'trek'

to look more pre-

sentable by using the

title()

method:

bicycles = \['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'\]

print(bicycles\[0\].title())

This example produces the same output as the preceding example,

except

'Trek'

is capitalized.

***Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1***

Python considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1.   
This is true of most programming languages, and the reason has to do with  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress073.png)

Introducing Lists

**35**

how the list operations are implemented at a lower level. If you're receiving   
unexpected results, ask yourself if you're making a simple but common off-  
by-one error.

The second item in a list has an index of 1. Using this counting sys-

tem, you can get any element you want from a list by subtracting one from   
its position in the list. For instance, to access the fourth item in a list, you   
request the item at index 3.

The following asks for the bicycles at index

1

and index

3

:

bicycles = \['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'\]

print(bicycles\[1\])  
print(bicycles\[3\])

This code returns the second and fourth bicycles in the list:

cannondale  
specialized

Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. If you

ask for the item at index

-1

, Python always returns the last item in the list:

bicycles = \['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'\]

print(bicycles\[-1\])

This code returns the value

'specialized'

. This syntax is quite useful,

because you'll often want to access the last items in a list without knowing   
exactly how long the list is. This convention extends to other negative index   
values as well. The index

-2

returns the second item from the end of the list,

the index

-3

returns the third item from the end, and so forth.

***Using Individual Values from a List***

You can use individual values from a list just as you would any other vari-  
able. For example, you can use f-strings to create a message based on a   
value from a list.

Let's try pulling the first bicycle from the list and composing a message

using that value:

bicycles = \['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'\]

message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles\[0\].title()}."

print(message)

We build a sentence using the value at

bicycles\[0\]

and assign it to the

variable

message

. The output is a simple sentence about the first bicycle in

the list:

My first bicycle was a Trek.

Chapter 3

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

Try these short programs to get some firsthand experience with Python's lists.   
You might want to create a new folder for each chapter's exercises, to keep   
them organized.

**3-1. Names:**

Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called

names

. Print

each person's name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

**3-2. Greetings:**

Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just

printing each person's name, print a message to them. The text of each mes-  
sage should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the   
person's name.

**3-3. Your Own List:**

Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a

motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list   
to print a series of statements about these items, such as "I would like to own a   
Honda motorcycle."

**Modifying, Adding, and Removing Elements**

Most lists you create will be *dynamic* , meaning you'll build a list and then   
add and remove elements from it as your program runs its course. For   
example, you might create a game in which a player has to shoot aliens out   
of the sky. You could store the initial set of aliens in a list and then remove   
an alien from the list each time one is shot down. Each time a new alien   
appears on the screen, you add it to the list. Your list of aliens will increase   
and decrease in length throughout the course of the game.

***Modifying Elements in a List***

The syntax for modifying an element is similar to the syntax for accessing   
an element in a list. To change an element, use the name of the list followed   
by the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new   
value you want that item to have.

For example, say we have a list of motorcycles and the first item in the

list is

'honda'

. We can change the value of this first item after the list has

been created:

*motorcycles.py*

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles\[0\] = 'ducati'  
print(motorcycles)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress075.png)

Introducing Lists

**37**

Here we define the list

motorcycles

, with

'honda'

as the first element.

Then we change the value of the first item to

'ducati'

. The output shows

that the first item has been changed, while the rest of the list stays the same:

\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
\['ducati', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

You can change the value of any item in a list, not just the first item.

***Adding Elements to a List***

You might want to add a new element to a list for many reasons. For   
example, you might want to make new aliens appear in a game, add new   
data to a visualization, or add new registered users to a website you've   
built. Python provides several ways to add new data to existing lists.

**Appending Elements to the End of a List**

The simplest way to add a new element to a list is to *append* the item to the   
list. When you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the end   
of the list. Using the same list we had in the previous example, we'll add the   
new element

'ducati'

to the end of the list:

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles.append('ducati')

print(motorcycles)

Here the

append()

method adds

'ducati'

to the end of the list, without

affecting any of the other elements in the list:

\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati'\]

The

append()

method makes it easy to build lists dynamically. For example,

you can start with an empty list and then add items to the list using a series   
of

append()

calls. Using an empty list, let's add the elements

'honda'

,

'yamaha'

,

and

'suzuki'

to the list:

motorcycles = \[\]

motorcycles.append('honda')  
motorcycles.append('yamaha')  
motorcycles.append('suzuki')

print(motorcycles)

The resulting list looks exactly the same as the lists in the previous

examples:

\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress076.png)

**38**

Chapter 3

Building lists this way is very common, because you often won't know

the data your users want to store in a program until after the program is   
running. To put your users in control, start by defining an empty list that   
will hold the users' values. Then append each new value provided to the list   
you just created.

**Inserting Elements into a List**

You can add a new element at any position in your list by using the

insert()

method. You do this by specifying the index of the new element and the   
value of the new item:

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')

print(motorcycles)

In this example, we insert the value

'ducati'

at the beginning of the

list. The

insert()

method opens a space at position

0

and stores the value

'ducati'

at that location:

\['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

This operation shifts every other value in the list one position to the

right.

***Removing Elements from a List***

Often, you'll want to remove an item or a set of items from a list. For example,   
when a player shoots down an alien from the sky, you'll most likely want to   
remove it from the list of active aliens. Or when a user decides to cancel   
their account on a web application you created, you'll want to remove that   
user from the list of active users. You can remove an item according to its   
position in the list or according to its value.

**Removing an Item Using the del Statement**

If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can   
use the

del

statement:

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

print(motorcycles)

del motorcycles\[0\]

print(motorcycles)

Here we use the

del

statement to remove the first item,

'honda'

, from the

list of motorcycles:

\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
\['yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress077.png)

Introducing Lists

**39**

You can remove an item from any position in a list using the

del

state-

ment if you know its index. For example, here's how to remove the second   
item,

'yamaha'

, from the list:

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
print(motorcycles)

del motorcycles\[1\]

print(motorcycles)

The second motorcycle is deleted from the list:

\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
\['honda', 'suzuki'\]

In both examples, you can no longer access the value that was removed

from the list after the

del

statement is used.

**Removing an Item Using the pop() Method**

Sometimes you'll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from a   
list. For example, you might want to get the *x* and *y* position of an alien that   
was just shot down, so you can draw an explosion at that position. In a web   
application, you might want to remove a user from a list of active members   
and then add that user to a list of inactive members.

The

pop()

method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work

with that item after removing it. The term *pop* comes from thinking of a   
list as a stack of items and popping one item off the top of the stack. In this   
analogy, the top of a stack corresponds to the end of a list.

Let's pop a motorcycle from the list of motorcycles:

1

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
print(motorcycles)

2

popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()

3

print(motorcycles)

4

print(popped_motorcycle)

We start by defining and printing the list

motorcycles

1

. Then we pop a

value from the list, and assign that value to the variable

popped_motorcycle

2

.

We print the list

3

to show that a value has been removed from the list.

Then we print the popped value

4

to prove that we still have access to the

value that was removed.

The output shows that the value

'suzuki'

was removed from the end of

the list and is now assigned to the variable

popped_motorcycle

:

\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
\['honda', 'yamaha'\]  
suzuki  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress078.png)

**40**

Chapter 3

How might this

pop()

method be useful? Imagine that the motorcycles

in the list are stored in chronological order, according to when we owned   
them. If this is the case, we can use the

pop()

method to print a statement

about the last motorcycle we bought:

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

last_owned = motorcycles.pop()  
print(f"The last motorcycle I owned was a {last_owned.title()}.")

The output is a simple sentence about the most recent motorcycle we

owned:

The last motorcycle I owned was a Suzuki.

**Popping Items from Any Position in a List**

You can use

pop()

to remove an item from any position in a list by including

the index of the item you want to remove in parentheses:

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)  
print(f"The first motorcycle I owned was a {first_owned.title()}.")

We start by popping the first motorcycle in the list, and then we print a

message about that motorcycle. The output is a simple sentence describing   
the first motorcycle I ever owned:

The first motorcycle I owned was a Honda.

Remember that each time you use

pop()

, the item you work with is no

longer stored in the list.

If you're unsure whether to use the

del

statement or the

pop()

method,

here's a simple way to decide: when you want to delete an item from a list   
and not use that item in any way, use the

del

statement; if you want to use an

item as you remove it, use the

pop()

method.

**Removing an Item by Value**

Sometimes you won't know the position of the value you want to remove   
from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you   
can use the

remove()

method.

For example, say we want to remove the value

'ducati'

from the list of

motorcycles:

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati'\]  
print(motorcycles)

motorcycles.remove('ducati')  
print(motorcycles)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress079.png)

Introducing Lists

**41**

Here the

remove()

method tells Python to figure out where

'ducati'

appears in the list and remove that element:

\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati'\]  
\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

You can also use the

remove()

method to work with a value that's being

removed from a list. Let's remove the value

'ducati'

and print a reason for

removing it from the list:

1

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati'\]  
print(motorcycles)

2

too_expensive = 'ducati'

3

motorcycles.remove(too_expensive)

print(motorcycles)

4

print(f"\\nA {too_expensive.title()} is too expensive for me.")

After defining the list

1

, we assign the value

'ducati'

to a variable

called

too_expensive

2

. We then use this variable to tell Python which value

to remove from the list

3

. The value

'ducati'

has been removed from

the list

4

but is still accessible through the variable

too_expensive

, allow-

ing us to print a statement about why we removed

'ducati'

from the list of

motorcycles:

\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati'\]  
\['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

A Ducati is too expensive for me.

**N O T E**

*The*

*remove()*

*method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there's*

*a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you'll need to use a loop
to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed. You'll learn how to do this in
[Chapter 7](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#151)* *.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

The following exercises are a bit more complex than those in [Chapter 2](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#53), but   
they give you an opportunity to use lists in all of the ways described.

**3-4. Guest List:**

If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who

would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you'd like to   
invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting   
them to dinner.

Chapter 3

**3-5. Changing Guest List:**

You just heard that one of your guests can't make the

dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You'll have to think of   
someone else to invite.

â¢ Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. Add a

print()

call at the end of

your program, stating the name of the guest who can't make it.

â¢ Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can't make it with the

name of the new person you are inviting.

â¢ Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in

your list.

**3-6. More Guests:**

You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is

available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

â¢ Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 or 3-5. Add a

print()

call to the

end of your program, informing people that you found a bigger table.

â¢ Use

insert()

to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.

â¢ Use

insert()

to add one new guest to the middle of your list.

â¢ Use

append()

to add one new guest to the end of your list.

â¢ Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

**3-7. Shrinking Guest List:**

You just found out that your new dinner table won't

arrive in time for the dinner, and now you have space for only two guests.

â¢ Start with your program from Exercise 3-6. Add a new line that prints a

message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

â¢ Use

pop()

to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two

names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a   
message to that person letting them know you're sorry you can't invite them   
to dinner.

â¢ Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them

know they're still invited.

â¢ Use

del

to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty

list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of   
your program.

**Organizing a List**

Often, your lists will be created in an unpredictable order, because you   
can't always control the order in which your users provide their data.   
Although this is unavoidable in most circumstances, you'll frequently want   
to present your information in a particular order. Sometimes you'll want  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress081.png)

Introducing Lists

**43**

to preserve the original order of your list, and other times you'll want to   
change the original order. Python provides a number of different ways to   
organize your lists, depending on the situation.

***Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method***

Python's

sort()

method makes it relatively easy to sort a list. Imagine we

have a list of cars and want to change the order of the list to store them   
alphabetically. To keep the task simple, let's assume that all the values in   
the list are lowercase:

*cars.py*

cars = \['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'\]  
cars.sort()  
print(cars)

The

sort()

method changes the order of the list permanently. The cars

are now in alphabetical order, and we can never revert to the original order:

\['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota'\]

You can also sort this list in reverse-alphabetical order by passing the

argument

reverse=True

to the

sort()

method. The following example sorts

the list of cars in reverse-alphabetical order:

cars = \['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'\]

cars.sort(reverse=True)

print(cars)

Again, the order of the list is permanently changed:

\['toyota', 'subaru', 'bmw', 'audi'\]

***Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function***

To maintain the original order of a list but present it in a sorted order, you   
can use the

sorted()

function. The

sorted()

function lets you display your list

in a particular order, but doesn't affect the actual order of the list.

Let's try this function on the list of cars.

cars = \['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'\]

1

print("Here is the original list:")

print(cars)

2

print("\\nHere is the sorted list:")

print(sorted(cars))

3

print("\\nHere is the original list again:")

print(cars)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress082.png)

**44**

Chapter 3

We first print the list in its original order

1

and then in alphabetical

order

2

. After the list is displayed in the new order, we show that the list is

still stored in its original order

3

:

Here is the original list:  
\['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'\]

Here is the sorted list:  
\['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota'\]

1

Here is the original list again:

\['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'\]

Notice that the list still exists in its original order

1

after the

sorted()

function has been used. The

sorted()

function can also accept a

reverse=True

argument if you want to display a list in reverse-alphabetical order.

**N O T E**

*Sorting a list alphabetically is a bit more complicated when all the values are not in*

*lowercase. There are several ways to interpret capital letters when determining a sort
order, and specifying the exact order can be more complex than we want to deal with
at this time. However, most approaches to sorting will build directly on what you
learned in this section.*

***Printing a List in Reverse Order***

To reverse the original order of a list, you can use the

reverse()

method. If

we originally stored the list of cars in chronological order according to when   
we owned them, we could easily rearrange the list into reverse-chronological   
order:

cars = \['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'\]

print(cars)

cars.reverse()  
print(cars)

Notice that

reverse()

doesn't sort backward alphabetically; it simply

reverses the order of the list:

\['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'\]  
\['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw'\]

The

reverse()

method changes the order of a list permanently, but you

can revert to the original order anytime by applying

reverse()

to the same

list a second time.

***Finding the Length of a List***

You can quickly find the length of a list by using the

len()

function. The list

in this example has four items, so its length is

4

:

\>\>\>

**cars = \['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru'\]**

\>\>\>

**len(cars)**

4  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress083.png)

Introducing Lists

**45**

You'll find

len()

useful when you need to identify the number of aliens

that still need to be shot down in a game, determine the amount of data   
you have to manage in a visualization, or figure out the number of regis-  
tered users on a website, among other tasks.

**N O T E**

*Python counts the items in a list starting with one, so you shouldn't run into any*

*off-by-one errors when determining the length of a list.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**3-8. Seeing the World:**

Think of at least five places in the world you'd like

to visit.

â¢ Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order.  
â¢ Print your list in its original order. Don't worry about printing the list neatly;

just print it as a raw Python list.

â¢ Use

sorted()

to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the

actual list.

â¢ Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.  
â¢ Use

sorted()

to print your list in reverse-alphabetical order without chang-

ing the order of the original list.

â¢ Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.  
â¢ Use

reverse()

to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its

order has changed.

â¢ Use

reverse()

to change the order of your list again. Print the list to show

it's back to its original order.

â¢ Use

sort()

to change your list so it's stored in alphabetical order. Print the

list to show that its order has been changed.

â¢ Use

sort()

to change your list so it's stored in reverse-alphabetical order.

Print the list to show that its order has changed.

**3-9. Dinner Guests:**

Working with one of the programs from Exercises 3-4

through 3-7 (page[s 41](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#79)--[42](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#80)), use

len()

to print a message indicating the number

of people you're inviting to dinner.

**3-10. Every Function:**

Think of things you could store in a list. For example, you

could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything   
else you'd like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items and   
then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once.

Chapter 3

**Avoiding Index Errors When Working with Lists**

There's one type of error that's common to see when you're working with   
lists for the first time. Let's say you have a list with three items, and you ask   
for the fourth item:

*motorcycles.py*

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]  
print(motorcycles\[3\])

This example results in an *index error*:

Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "motorcycles.py", line 2, in \<module\>  
print(motorcycles\[3\])  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\^\^\^  
IndexError: list index out of range

Python attempts to give you the item at index 3. But when it searches

the list, no item in

motorcycles

has an index of 3. Because of the off-by-one

nature of indexing in lists, this error is typical. People think the third item   
is item number 3, because they start counting at 1. But in Python the third   
item is number 2, because it starts indexing at 0.

An index error means Python can't find an item at the index you

requested. If an index error occurs in your program, try adjusting the   
index you're asking for by one. Then run the program again to see if the   
results are correct.

Keep in mind that whenever you want to access the last item in a list,

you should use the index

-1

. This will always work, even if your list has

changed size since the last time you accessed it:

motorcycles = \['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'\]

print(motorcycles\[-1\])

The index

-1

always returns the last item in a list, in this case the value

'suzuki'

:

suzuki

The only time this approach will cause an error is when you request the

last item from an empty list:

motorcycles = \[\]  
print(motorcycles\[-1\])

No items are in

motorcycles

, so Python returns another index error:

Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "motorcyles.py", line 3, in \<module\>  
print(motorcycles\[-1\])  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\^\^\^\^  
IndexError: list index out of range  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress085.png)

Introducing Lists

**47**

If an index error occurs and you can't figure out how to resolve it, try

printing your list or just printing the length of your list. Your list might look   
much different than you thought it did, especially if it has been managed   
dynamically by your program. Seeing the actual list, or the exact number of   
items in your list, can help you sort out such logical errors.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**3-11. Intentional Error:**

If you haven't received an index error in one of your pro-

grams yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs   
to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the   
program.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned what lists are and how to work with the indi-  
vidual items in a list. You learned how to define a list and how to add and   
remove elements. You learned how to sort lists permanently and temporar-

how to avoid index errors when you're working with lists.

In [Chapter 4 y](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#87)ou'll learn how to work with items in a list more efficiently.

By looping through each item in a list using just a few lines of code you'll be   
able to work efficiently, even when your list contains thousands or millions

In [Chapter 3](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#71) you learned how to make a

simple list, and you learned to work with the

individual elements in a list. In this chapter

you'll learn how to loop through an entire list

using just a few lines of code, regardless of how long the   
list is. *Looping* allows you to take the same action, or set   
of actions, with every item in a list. As a result, you'll be   
able to work efficiently with lists of any length, including   
those with thousands or even millions of items.

**Looping Through an Entire List**

You'll often want to run through all entries in a list, performing the same   
task with each item. For example, in a game you might want to move every   
element on the screen by the same amount. In a list of numbers, you   
might want to perform the same statistical operation on every element.

Chapter 4

Or perhaps you'll want to display each headline from a list of articles on a   
website. When you want to do the same action with every item in a list, you   
can use Python's

for

loop.

Say we have a list of magicians' names, and we want to print out each

name in the list. We could do this by retrieving each name from the list indi-  
vidually, but this approach could cause several problems. For one, it would   
be repetitive to do this with a long list of names. Also, we'd have to change   
our code each time the list's length changed. Using a

for

loop avoids both of

these issues by letting Python manage these issues internally.

Let's use a

for

loop to print out each name in a list of magicians:

*magicians.py*

magicians = \['alice', 'david', 'carolina'\]  
for magician in magicians:  
print(magician)

We begin by defining a list, just as we did i[n Chapter 3. T](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#71)hen we define

a

for

loop. This line tells Python to pull a name from the list

magicians

,

and associate it with the variable

magician

. Next, we tell Python to print the

name that's just been assigned to

magician

. Python then repeats these last

two lines, once for each name in the list. It might help to read this code as   
"For every magician in the list of magicians, print the magician's name."   
The output is a simple printout of each name in the list:

alice  
david  
carolina

***A Closer Look at Looping***

Looping is important because it's one of the most common ways a computer   
automates repetitive tasks. For example, in a simple loop like we used in   
*magicians.py*, Python initially reads the first line of the loop:

for magician in magicians:

This line tells Python to retrieve the first value from the list

magicians

and associate it with the variable

magician

. This first value is

'alice'

. Python

then reads the next line:

print(magician)

Python prints the current value of

magician

, which is still

'alice'

. Because

the list contains more values, Python returns to the first line of the loop:

for magician in magicians:

Python retrieves the next name in the list,

'david'

, and associates that

value with the variable

magician

. Python then executes the line:

print(magician)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress089.png)

Working with Lists

**51**

Python prints the current value of

magician

again, which is now

'david'

.

Python repeats the entire loop once more with the last value in the list,

'carolina'

. Because no more values are in the list, Python moves on to the

next line in the program. In this case nothing comes after the

for

loop, so

the program ends.

When you're using loops for the first time, keep in mind that the set of

steps is repeated once for each item in the list, no matter how many items   
are in the list. If you have a million items in your list, Python repeats these   
steps a million times---and usually very quickly.

Also keep in mind when writing your own

for

loops that you can choose

any name you want for the temporary variable that will be associated with   
each value in the list. However, it's helpful to choose a meaningful name   
that represents a single item from the list. For example, here's a good way to   
start a

for

loop for a list of cats, a list of dogs, and a general list of items:

for cat in cats:  
for dog in dogs:  
for item in list_of_items:

These naming conventions can help you follow the action being done

on each item within a

for

loop. Using singular and plural names can help

you identify whether a section of code is working with a single element from   
the list or the entire list.

***Doing More Work Within a for Loop***

You can do just about anything with each item in a

for

loop. Let's build on

the previous example by printing a message to each magician, telling them   
that they performed a great trick:

*magicians.py*

magicians = \['alice', 'david', 'carolina'\]  
for magician in magicians:

print(f"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!")

The only difference in this code is where we compose a message to each

magician, starting with that magician's name. The first time through the   
loop the value of

magician

is

'alice'

, so Python starts the first message with the

name

'Alice'

. The second time through, the message will begin with

'David'

,

and the third time through, the message will begin with

'Carolina'

.

The output shows a personalized message for each magician in the list:

Alice, that was a great trick!  
David, that was a great trick!  
Carolina, that was a great trick!

You can also write as many lines of code as you like in the

for

loop. Every

indented line following the line

for magician in magicians

is considered*inside*

*the loop* , and each indented line is executed once for each value in the list.   
Therefore, you can do as much work as you like with each value in the list.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress090.png)

**52**

Chapter 4

Let's add a second line to our message, telling each magician that we're

looking forward to their next trick:

magicians = \['alice', 'david', 'carolina'\]  
for magician in magicians:  
print(f"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!")

print(f"I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\n")

Because we have indented both calls to

print()

, each line will be exe-

cuted once for every magician in the list. The newline (

"\\n"

) in the second

print()

call inserts a blank line after each pass through the loop. This cre-

ates a set of messages that are neatly grouped for each person in the list:

Alice, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, Alice.

David, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, David.

Carolina, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, Carolina.

You can use as many lines as you like in your

for

loops. In practice,

you'll often find it useful to do a number of different operations with each   
item in a list when you use a

for

loop.

***Doing Something After a for Loop***

What happens once a

for

loop has finished executing? Usually, you'll want

to summarize a block of output or move on to other work that your pro-  
gram must accomplish.

Any lines of code after the

for

loop that are not indented are executed

once without repetition. Let's write a thank you to the group of magicians   
as a whole, thanking them for putting on an excellent show. To display this   
group message after all of the individual messages have been printed, we   
place the thank you message after the

for

loop, without indentation:

magicians = \['alice', 'david', 'carolina'\]  
for magician in magicians:  
print(f"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!")  
print(f"I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\n")

print("Thank you, everyone. That was a great magic show!")

The first two calls to

print()

are repeated once for each magician in the

list, as you saw earlier. However, because the last line is not indented, it's   
printed only once:

Alice, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, Alice.

David, that was a great trick!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress091.png)

Working with Lists

**53**

I can't wait to see your next trick, David.

Carolina, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, Carolina.

Thank you, everyone. That was a great magic show!

When you're processing data using a

for

loop, you'll find that this is a

good way to summarize an operation that was performed on an entire data-  
set. For example, you might use a

for

loop to initialize a game by running

through a list of characters and displaying each character on the screen.   
You might then write some additional code after this loop that displays a   
*Play Now* button after all the characters have been drawn to the screen.

**Avoiding Indentation Errors**

Python uses indentation to determine how a line, or group of lines, is related   
to the rest of the program. In the previous examples, the lines that printed   
messages to individual magicians were part of the

for

loop because they

were indented. Python's use of indentation makes code very easy to read.   
Basically, it uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code with   
a clear visual structure. In longer Python programs, you'll notice blocks of   
code indented at a few different levels. These indentation levels help you   
gain a general sense of the overall program's organization.

As you begin to write code that relies on proper indentation, you'll

need to watch for a few common *indentation errors* . For example, people   
sometimes indent lines of code that don't need to be indented or forget   
to indent lines that need to be indented. Seeing examples of these errors   
now will help you avoid them in the future and correct them when they do   
appear in your own programs.

Let's examine some of the more common indentation errors.

***Forgetting to Indent***

Always indent the line after the

for

statement in a loop. If you forget, Python

will remind you:

*magicians.py*

magicians = \['alice', 'david', 'carolina'\]  
for magician in magicians:

1

print(magician)

The call to

print()

1

should be indented, but it's not. When Python

expects an indented block and doesn't find one, it lets you know which line   
it had a problem with:

File "magicians.py", line 3  
print(magician)  
\^  
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line 2  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress092.png)

**54**

Chapter 4

You can usually resolve this kind of indentation error by indenting the

line or lines immediately after the

for

statement.

***Forgetting to Indent Additional Lines***

Sometimes your loop will run without any errors but won't produce the   
expected result. This can happen when you're trying to do several tasks   
in a loop and you forget to indent some of its lines.

For example, this is what happens when we forget to indent the second

line in the loop that tells each magician we're looking forward to their next   
trick:

magicians = \['alice', 'david', 'carolina'\]  
for magician in magicians:  
print(f"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!")

1

print(f"I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\n")

The second call to

print()

1

is supposed to be indented, but because

Python finds at least one indented line after the

for

statement, it doesn't

report an error. As a result, the first

print()

call is executed once for each

name in the list because it is indented. The second

print()

call is not

indented, so it is executed only once after the loop has finished running.   
Because the final value associated with

magician

is

'carolina'

, she is the only

one who receives the "looking forward to the next trick" message:

Alice, that was a great trick!  
David, that was a great trick!  
Carolina, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, Carolina.

This is a *logical error*. The syntax is valid Python code, but the code does

not produce the desired result because a problem occurs in its logic. If you   
expect to see a certain action repeated once for each item in a list and it's   
executed only once, determine whether you need to simply indent a line or   
a group of lines.

***Indenting Unnecessarily***

If you accidentally indent a line that doesn't need to be indented, Python   
informs you about the unexpected indent:

*hello_world.py*

message = "Hello Python world!"  
print(message)

We don't need to indent the

print()

call, because it isn't part of a loop;

hence, Python reports that error:

File "hello_world.py", line 2  
print(message)  
\^  
IndentationError: unexpected indent  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress093.png)

Working with Lists

**55**

You can avoid unexpected indentation errors by indenting only when

you have a specific reason to do so. In the programs you're writing at this   
point, the only lines you should indent are the actions you want to repeat   
for each item in a

for

loop.

***Indenting Unnecessarily After the Loop***

If you accidentally indent code that should run after a loop has finished,   
that code will be repeated once for each item in the list. Sometimes this   
prompts Python to report an error, but often this will result in a logical   
error.

For example, let's see what happens when we accidentally indent the

line that thanked the magicians as a group for putting on a good show:

*magicians.py*

magicians = \['alice', 'david', 'carolina'\]  
for magician in magicians:  
print(f"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!")  
print(f"I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\n")

1

print("Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!")

Because the last line

1

is indented, it's printed once for each person in

the list:

Alice, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, Alice.

Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!  
David, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, David.

Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!  
Carolina, that was a great trick!  
I can't wait to see your next trick, Carolina.

Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!

This is another logical error, similar to the one in "Forgetting to Indent

Additional Lines" on [page 54. B](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#92)ecause Python doesn't know what you're   
trying to accomplish with your code, it will run all code that is written in   
valid syntax. If an action is repeated many times when it should be executed   
only once, you probably need to unindent the code for that action.

***Forgetting the Colon***

The colon at the end of a

for

statement tells Python to interpret the next

line as the start of a loop.

magicians = \['alice', 'david', 'carolina'\]

1

for magician in magicians

print(magician)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress094.png)

**56**

Chapter 4

If you accidentally forget the colon

1

, you'll get a syntax error because

Python doesn't know exactly what you're trying to do:

File "magicians.py", line 2  
for magician in magicians  
\^  
SyntaxError: expected ':'

Python doesn't know if you simply forgot the colon, or if you meant

to write additional code to set up a more complex loop. If the interpreter   
can identify a possible fix it will suggest one, like adding a colon at the end   
of a line, as it does here with the response

expected ':'

. Some errors have

easy, obvious fixes, thanks to the suggestions in Python's tracebacks. Some   
errors are much harder to resolve, even when the eventual fix only involves   
a single character. Don't feel bad when a small fix takes a long time to find;   
you are absolutely not alone in this experience.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**4-1. Pizzas:**

Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these

pizza names in a list, and then use a

for

loop to print the name of each pizza.

â¢ Modify your

for

loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza,

instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza, you should   
have one line of output containing a simple statement like

*I like pep-*

*peroni pizza*

.

â¢ Add a line at the end of your program, outside the

for

loop, that states

how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines   
about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as

*I really love pizza!*

**4-2. Animals:**

Think of at least three different animals that have a common char-

acteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a

for

loop to

print out the name of each animal.

â¢ Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as

*A*

*dog would make a great pet.*

â¢ Add a line at the end of your program, stating what these animals have in

common. You could print a sentence, such as

*Any of these animals would*

*make a great pet!*

**Making Numerical Lists**

Many reasons exist to store a set of numbers. For example, you'll need to   
keep track of the positions of each character in a game, and you might want  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress095.png)

Working with Lists

**57**

to keep track of a player's high scores as well. In data visualizations, you'll   
almost always work with sets of numbers, such as temperatures, distances,   
population sizes, or latitude and longitude values, among other types of   
numerical sets.

Lists are ideal for storing sets of numbers, and Python provides a variety

of tools to help you work efficiently with lists of numbers. Once you under-  
stand how to use these tools effectively, your code will work well even when   
your lists contain millions of items.

***Using the range() Function***

Python's

range()

function makes it easy to generate a series of numbers.

For example, you can use the

range()

function to print a series of numbers

like this:

*first_numbers.py*

for value in range(1, 5):  
print(value)

Although this code looks like it should print the numbers from 1 to 5, it

doesn't print the number 5:

1  
2  
3  
4

In this example,

range()

prints only the numbers 1 through 4. This is

another result of the off-by-one behavior you'll see often in programming   
languages. The

range()

function causes Python to start counting at the first

value you give it, and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide.   
Because it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end   
value, which would have been 5 in this case.

To print the numbers from 1 to 5, you would use

range(1, 6)

:

for value in range(1, 6):  

print(value)

This time the output starts at 1 and ends at 5:

1  
2  
3  
4  
5

If your output is different from what you expect when you're using

range()

, try adjusting your end value by 1.

You can also pass

range()

only one argument, and it will start the

sequence of numbers at 0. For example,

range(6)

would return the numbers

from 0 through 5.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress096.png)

**58**

Chapter 4

***Using range() to Make a List of Numbers***

If you want to make a list of numbers, you can convert the results of

range()

directly into a list using the

list()

function. When you wrap

list()

around a

call to the

range()

function, the output will be a list of numbers.

In the example in the previous section, we simply printed out a series of

numbers. We can use

list()

to convert that same set of numbers into a list:

numbers = list(range(1, 6))  
print(numbers)

This is the result:

\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]

We can also use the

range()

function to tell Python to skip numbers in a

given range. If you pass a third argument to

range()

, Python uses that value

as a step size when generating numbers.

For example, here's how to list the even numbers between 1 and 10:

*even_numbers.py*

even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2))  
print(even_numbers)

In this example, the

range()

function starts with the value 2 and then

adds 2 to that value. It adds 2 repeatedly until it reaches or passes the end   
value, 11, and produces this result:

\[2, 4, 6, 8, 10\]

You can create almost any set of numbers you want to using the

range()

function. For example, consider how you might make a list of the first 10   
square numbers (that is, the square of each integer from 1 through 10). In   
Python, two asterisks (

\*\*

) represent exponents. Here's how you might put

the first 10 square numbers into a list:

*square*

*_numbers.py*

squares = \[\]  
for value in range(1, 11):

1

square = value \*\* 2

2

squares.append(square)

print(squares)

We start with an empty list called

squares

. Then, we tell Python to loop

through each value from 1 to 10 using the

range()

function. Inside the loop,

the current value is raised to the second power and assigned to the variable

square

1

. Each new value of

square

is then appended to the list

squares

2

.

Finally, when the loop has finished running, the list of squares is printed:

\[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100\]  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress097.png)

Working with Lists

**59**

To write this code more concisely, omit the temporary variable

square

and append each new value directly to the list:

squares = \[\]  
for value in range(1,11):

squares.append(value\*\*2)

print(squares)

This line does the same work as the lines inside the

for

loop in the pre-

vious listing. Each value in the loop is raised to the second power and then   
immediately appended to the list of squares.

You can use either of these approaches when you're making more com-

plex lists. Sometimes using a temporary variable makes your code easier to   
read; other times it makes the code unnecessarily long. Focus first on writ-  
ing code that you understand clearly, and does what you want it to do. Then   
look for more efficient approaches as you review your code.

***Simple Statistics with a List of Numbers***

A few Python functions are helpful when working with lists of numbers. For   
example, you can easily find the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list of   
numbers:

\>\>\>

**digits = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0\]**

\>\>\>

**min(digits)**

0  
\>\>\>

**max(digits)**

9  
\>\>\>

**sum(digits)**

45

**N O T E**

*The examples in this section use short lists of numbers that fit easily on the page. They*

*would work just as well if your list contained a million or more numbers.*

***List Comprehensions***

The approach described earlier for generating the list

squares

consisted of

using three or four lines of code. A *list comprehension* allows you to generate   
this same list in just one line of code. A list comprehension combines the

for

loop and the creation of new elements into one line, and automatically

appends each new element. List comprehensions are not always presented   
to beginners, but I've included them here because you'll most likely see   
them as soon as you start looking at other people's code.

The following example builds the same list of square numbers you saw

earlier but uses a list comprehension:

*squares.py*

squares = \[value\*\*2 for value in range(1, 11)\]  
print(squares)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress098.png)

**60**

Chapter 4

To use this syntax, begin with a descriptive name for the list, such as

squares

. Next, open a set of square brackets and define the expression for

the values you want to store in the new list. In this example the expression is

value\*\*2

, which raises the value to the second power. Then, write a

for

loop

to generate the numbers you want to feed into the expression, and close the   
square brackets. The

for

loop in this example is

for value in range(1, 11)

,

which feeds the values 1 through 10 into the expression

value\*\*2

. Note that

no colon is used at the end of the

for

statement.

The result is the same list of square numbers you saw earlier:

\[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100\]

It takes practice to write your own list comprehensions, but you'll find

them worthwhile once you become comfortable creating ordinary lists.   
When you're writing three or four lines of code to generate lists and it   
begins to feel repetitive, consider writing your own list comprehensions.

Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and

then use

min()

and

max()

to make sure your list actually starts at one and ends

at one million. Also, use the

sum()

function to see how quickly Python can add

a million numbers.

**4-6. Odd Numbers:**

Use the third argument of the

range()

function to make a list

of the odd numbers from 1 to 20. Use a

for

loop to print each number.

**4-7. Threes:**

Make a list of the multiples of 3, from 3 to 30. Use a

for

loop to

print the numbers in your list.

**4-8. Cubes:**

A number raised to the third power is called a

*cube*

. For example,

the cube of 2 is written as

2\*\*3

in Python. Make a list of the first 10 cubes (that

is, the cube of each integer from 1 through 10), and use a

for

loop to print out

the value of each cube.

**4-9. Cube Comprehension:**

Use a list comprehension to generate a list of the first

10 cubes.

**Working with Part of a List**

I[n Chapter 3](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#71) you learned how to access single elements in a list, and in this   
chapter you've been learning how to work through all the elements in a   
list. You can also work with a specific group of items in a list, called a *slice* in   
Python.

***Slicing a List***

To make a slice, you specify the index of the first and last elements you want   
to work with. As with the

range()

function, Python stops one item before the

second index you specify. To output the first three elements in a list, you   
would request indices

0

through

3

, which would return elements

0

,

1

, and

2

.

The following example involves a list of players on a team:

*players.py*

players = \['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'\]  
print(players\[0:3\])

This code prints a slice of the list. The output retains the structure of

the list, and includes the first three players in the list:

\['charles', 'martina', 'michael'\]

You can generate any subset of a list. For example, if you want the sec-

ond, third, and fourth items in a list, you would start the slice at index

1

and

end it at index

4

:

players = \['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'\]

print(players\[1:4\])

This time the slice starts with

'martina'

and ends with

'florence'

:

\['martina', 'michael', 'florence'\]

If you omit the first index in a slice, Python automatically starts your

slice at the beginning of the list:

players = \['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'\]

print(players\[:4\])

Without a starting index, Python starts at the beginning of the list:

\['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence'\]

A similar syntax works if you want a slice that includes the end of a list.

For example, if you want all items from the third item through the last item,   
you can start with index

2

and omit the second index:

players = \['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'\]

print(players\[2:\])  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress100.png)

**62**

Chapter 4

Python returns all items from the third item through the end of the list:

\['michael', 'florence', 'eli'\]

This syntax allows you to output all of the elements from any point in

your list to the end, regardless of the length of the list. Recall that a nega-  
tive index returns an element a certain distance from the end of a list;   
therefore, you can output any slice from the end of a list. For example, if   
we want to output the last three players on the roster, we can use the slice

players\[-3:\]

:

players = \['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'\]

print(players\[-3:\])

This prints the names of the last three players and will continue to work

as the list of players changes in size.

**N O T E**

*You can include a third value in the brackets indicating a slice. If a third value is*

*included, this tells Python how many items to skip between items in the specified
range.*

***Looping Through a Slice***

You can use a slice in a

for

loop if you want to loop through a subset of the

elements in a list. In the next example, we loop through the first three play-  
ers and print their names as part of a simple roster:

players = \['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'\]

print("Here are the first three players on my team:")

1

for player in players\[:3\]:

print(player.title())

Instead of looping through the entire list of players, Python loops

through only the first three names

1

:

Here are the first three players on my team:  
Charles  
Martina  
Michael

Slices are very useful in a number of situations. For instance, when

you're creating a game, you could add a player's final score to a list every   
time that player finishes playing. You could then get a player's top three   
scores by sorting the list in decreasing order and taking a slice that includes   
just the first three scores. When you're working with data, you can use slices   
to process your data in chunks of a specific size. Or, when you're building   
a web application, you could use slices to display information in a series of   
pages with an appropriate amount of information on each page.

Working with Lists

**63**

***Copying a List***

Often, you'll want to start with an existing list and make an entirely new list   
based on the first one. Let's explore how copying a list works and examine   
one situation in which copying a list is useful.

To copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list

by omitting the first index and the second index (

\[:\]

). This tells Python to

make a slice that starts at the first item and ends with the last item, produc-  
ing a copy of the entire list.

For example, imagine we have a list of our favorite foods and want to

make a separate list of foods that a friend likes. This friend likes everything   
in our list so far, so we can create their list by copying ours:

*foods.py*

my_foods = \['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'\]

1

friend_foods = my_foods\[:\]

print("My favorite foods are:")  
print(my_foods)

print("\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")  
print(friend_foods)

First, we make a list of the foods we like called

my_foods

. Then we make

a new list called

friend_foods

. We make a copy of

my_foods

by asking for a

slice of

my_foods

without specifying any indices

1

, and assign the copy to

friend_foods

. When we print each list, we see that they both contain the

same foods:

My favorite foods are:  
\['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'\]

My friend's favorite foods are:  
\['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'\]

To prove that we actually have two separate lists, we'll add a new food

to each list and show that each list keeps track of the appropriate person's   
favorite foods:

my_foods = \['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'\]

1

friend_foods = my_foods\[:\]

2

my_foods.append('cannoli')

3

friend_foods.append('ice cream')

print("My favorite foods are:")  
print(my_foods)

print("\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")  
print(friend_foods)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress102.png)

**64**

Chapter 4

We copy the original items in

my_foods

to the new list

friend_foods

, as we

did in the previous example

1

. Next, we add a new food to each list: we add

'cannoli'

to

my_foods

2

, and we add

'ice cream'

to

friend_foods

3

. We then

print the two lists to see whether each of these foods is in the appropriate list:

My favorite foods are:  
\['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli'\]

My friend's favorite foods are:  
\['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'ice cream'\]

The output shows that

'cannoli'

now appears in our list of favorite foods

but

'ice cream'

does not. We can see that

'ice cream'

now appears in our

friend's list but

'cannoli'

does not. If we had simply set

friend_foods

equal to

my_foods

, we would not produce two separate lists. For example, here's what

happens when you try to copy a list without using a slice:

my_foods = \['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'\]

# This doesn't work:  
friend_foods = my_foods

my_foods.append('cannoli')  
friend_foods.append('ice cream')

print("My favorite foods are:")  
print(my_foods)

print("\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")  
print(friend_foods)

Instead of assigning a copy of

my_foods

to

friend_foods

, we set

friend_foods

equal to

my_foods

. This syntax actually tells Python to associate the new vari-

able

friend_foods

with the list that is already associated with

my_foods

, so now

both variables point to the same list. As a result, when we add

'cannoli'

to

my_foods

, it will also appear in

friend_foods

. Likewise

'ice cream'

will appear

in both lists, even though it appears to be added only to

friend_foods

.

The output shows that both lists are the same now, which is not what we

wanted:

My favorite foods are:  
\['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli', 'ice cream'\]

My friend's favorite foods are:  
\['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli', 'ice cream'\]

**N O T E**

*Don't worry about the details in this example for now. If you're trying to work with*

*a copy of a list and you see unexpected behavior, make sure you are copying the list
using a slice, as we did in the first example.*

Working with Lists

**65**

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**4-10. Slices:**

Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several

lines to the end of the program that do the following:

â¢ Print the message

*The first three items in the list are:*

. Then use a slice to

print the first three items from that program's list.

â¢ Print the message

*Three items from the middle of the list are:*

. Then use a

slice to print three items from the middle of the list.

â¢ Print the message

*The last three items in the list are:*

. Then use a slice to

print the last three items in the list.

**4-11. My Pizzas, Your Pizzas:**

Start with your program from [Exercise 4-1 (page 56](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#94)).

Make a copy of the list of pizzas, and call it

friend_pizzas

. Then, do the

following:

â¢ Add a new pizza to the original list.  
â¢ Add a different pizza to the list

friend_pizzas

.

â¢ Prove that you have two separate lists. Print the message

*My favorite piz-*

*zas are:*

, and then use a

for

loop to print the first list. Print the message

*My*

*friend's favorite pizzas are:*

, and then use a

for

loop to print the second list.

Make sure each new pizza is stored in the appropriate list.

**4-12. More Loops:**

All versions of

*foods.py*

in this section have avoided using

for

loops when printing, to save space. Choose a version of

*foods.py*

, and

write two

for

loops to print each list of foods.

**Tuples**

Lists work well for storing collections of items that can change throughout the   
life of a program. The ability to modify lists is particularly important when   
you're working with a list of users on a website or a list of characters in a game.   
However, sometimes you'll want to create a list of items that cannot change.   
Tuples allow you to do just that. Python refers to values that cannot change as   
*immutable* , and an immutable list is called a *tuple*.

***Defining a Tuple***

A tuple looks just like a list, except you use parentheses instead of square   
brackets. Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by   
using each item's index, just as you would for a list.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress104.png)

**66**

Chapter 4

For example, if we have a rectangle that should always be a certain size, we

can ensure that its size doesn't change by putting the dimensions into a tuple:

*dimensions.py*

dimensions = (200, 50)  
print(dimensions\[0\])  
print(dimensions\[1\])

We define the tuple

dimensions

, using parentheses instead of square

brackets. Then we print each element in the tuple individually, using the   
same syntax we've been using to access elements in a list:

200  
50

Let's see what happens if we try to change one of the items in the tuple

dimensions

:

dimensions = (200, 50)

dimensions\[0\] = 250

This code tries to change the value of the first dimension, but Python

returns a type error. Because we're trying to alter a tuple, which can't be   
done to that type of object, Python tells us we can't assign a new value to   
an item in a tuple:

Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "dimensions.py", line 2, in \<module\>  
dimensions\[0\] = 250  
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

This is beneficial because we want Python to raise an error when a line

of code tries to change the dimensions of the rectangle.

**N O T E**

*Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses make them*

*look neater and more readable. If you want to define a tuple with one element, you
need to include a trailing comma:*

my_t = (3,)

*It doesn't often make sense to build a tuple with one element, but this can happen*

*when tuples are generated automatically.*

***Looping Through All Values in a Tuple***

You can loop over all the values in a tuple using a

for

loop, just as you did

with a list:

dimensions = (200, 50)

for dimension in dimensions:  
print(dimension)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress105.png)

Working with Lists

**67**

Python returns all the elements in the tuple, just as it would for a list:

200  
50

***Writing Over a Tuple***

Although you can't modify a tuple, you can assign a new value to a variable   
that represents a tuple. For example, if we wanted to change the dimensions   
of this rectangle, we could redefine the entire tuple:

dimensions = (200, 50)

print("Original dimensions:")  
for dimension in dimensions:  
print(dimension)

dimensions = (400, 100)  
print("\\nModified dimensions:")  
for dimension in dimensions:  
print(dimension)

The first four lines define the original tuple and print the initial dimen-

sions. We then associate a new tuple with the variable

dimensions

, and print

the new values. Python doesn't raise any errors this time, because reassign-  
ing a variable is valid:

Original dimensions:  
200  
50

Modified dimensions:  
400  
100

When compared with lists, tuples are simple data structures. Use them

when you want to store a set of values that should not be changed through-  
out the life of a program.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**4-13. Buffet:**

A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five

simple foods, and store them in a tuple.

â¢ Use a

for

loop to print each food the restaurant offers.

â¢ Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the

change.

â¢ The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different

foods. Add a line that rewrites the tuple, and then use a

for

loop to print

each of the items on the revised menu.

Chapter 4

**Styling Your Code**

Now that you're writing longer programs, it's a good idea to learn how to   
style your code consistently. Take the time to make your code as easy as pos-  
sible to read. Writing easy-to-read code helps you keep track of what your   
programs are doing and helps others understand your code as well.

Python programmers have agreed on a number of styling conventions

to ensure that everyone's code is structured in roughly the same way. Once   
you've learned to write clean Python code, you should be able to understand   
the overall structure of anyone else's Python code, as long as they follow the   
same guidelines. If you're hoping to become a professional programmer at   
some point, you should begin following these guidelines as soon as possible   
to develop good habits.

***The Style Guide***

When someone wants to make a change to the Python language, they write   
a *Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)* . One of the oldest PEPs is *PEP 8* , which   
instructs Python programmers on how to style their code. PEP 8 is fairly   
lengthy, but much of it relates to more complex coding structures than what   
you've seen so far.

The Python style guide was written with the understanding that code

is read more often than it is written. You'll write your code once and then   
start reading it as you begin debugging. When you add features to a pro-  
gram, you'll spend more time reading your code. When you share your   
code with other programmers, they'll read your code as well.

Given the choice between writing code that's easier to write or code

that's easier to read, Python programmers will almost always encourage you   
to write code that's easier to read. The following guidelines will help you   
write clear code from the start.

***Indentation***

PEP 8 recommends that you use four spaces per indentation level. Using   
four spaces improves readability while leaving room for multiple levels of   
indentation on each line.

In a word processing document, people often use tabs rather than

spaces to indent. This works well for word processing documents, but the   
Python interpreter gets confused when tabs are mixed with spaces. Every   
text editor provides a setting that lets you use the TAB key but then converts   
each tab to a set number of spaces. You should definitely use your TAB key,   
but also make sure your editor is set to insert spaces rather than tabs into   
your document.

Mixing tabs and spaces in your file can cause problems that are very

difficult to diagnose. If you think you have a mix of tabs and spaces, you   
can convert all tabs in a file to spaces in most editors.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress107.png)

Working with Lists

**69**

***Line Length***

Many Python programmers recommend that each line should be less than   
80 characters. Historically, this guideline developed because most com-  
puters could fit only 79 characters on a single line in a terminal window.   
Currently, people can fit much longer lines on their screens, but other rea-  
sons exist to adhere to the 79-character standard line length.

Professional programmers often have several files open on the same

screen, and using the standard line length allows them to see entire lines   
in two or three files that are open side by side onscreen. PEP 8 also rec-  
ommends that you limit all of your comments to 72 characters per line,   
because some of the tools that generate automatic documentation for   
larger projects add formatting characters at the beginning of each com-  
mented line.

The PEP 8 guidelines for line length are not set in stone, and some

teams prefer a 99-character limit. Don't worry too much about line length   
in your code as you're learning, but be aware that people who are working   
collaboratively almost always follow the PEP 8 guidelines. Most editors allow   
you to set up a visual cue, usually a vertical line on your screen, that shows   
you where these limits are.

**N O T E**

*[Appendix B](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#501)* *shows you how to configure your text editor so it always inserts four*

*spaces each time you press the TAB key and shows a vertical guideline to help you follow
the 79-character limit.*

***Blank Lines***

To group parts of your program visually, use blank lines. You should use   
blank lines to organize your files, but don't do so excessively. By following   
the examples provided in this book, you should strike the right balance.   
For example, if you have five lines of code that build a list and then another   
three lines that do something with that list, it's appropriate to place a blank   
line between the two sections. However, you should not place three or four   
blank lines between the two sections.

Blank lines won't affect how your code runs, but they will affect the

readability of your code. The Python interpreter uses horizontal inden-  
tation to interpret the meaning of your code, but it disregards vertical   
spacing.

***Other Style Guidelines***

PEP 8 has many additional styling recommendations, but most of the   
guidelines refer to more complex programs than what you're writing at this   
point. As you learn more complex Python structures, I'll share the relevant   
parts of the PEP 8 guidelines.

to skim through it.

**4-15. Code Review:**

Choose three of the programs you've written in this chapter

and modify each one to comply with PEP 8.

â¢ Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to insert four

spaces every time you press the TAB key, if you haven't already done so   
(see[Appendix B f](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#501)or instructions on how to do this).

â¢ Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to show a

vertical guideline at the 80th character position.

â¢ Don't use blank lines excessively in your program files.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a   
list. You learned how to work through a list using a

for

loop, how Python

uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common   
indentation errors. You learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a   
few operations you can perform on numerical lists. You learned how to slice   
a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a   
slice. You also learned about tuples, which provide a degree of protection   
to a set of values that shouldn't change, and how to style your increasingly   
complex code to make it easy to read.

In [Chapter 5, y](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#109)ou'll learn to respond appropriately to different condi-

tions by using

if

statements. You'll learn to string together relatively complex

sets of conditional tests to respond appropriately to exactly the kind of situa-  
tion or information you're looking for. You'll also learn to use

if

statements

while looping through a list to take specific actions with selected elements   
from a list.

**I F S T A T E M E N T S**

Programming often involves examining

a set of conditions and deciding which

action to take based on those conditions.

Python's

if

statement allows you to examine

the current state of a program and respond appro-  
priately to that state.

In this chapter, you'll learn to write conditional tests, which allow you

to check any condition of interest. You'll learn to write simple

if

statements,

and you'll learn how to create a more complex series of

if

statements to

identify when the exact conditions you want are present. You'll then apply   
this concept to lists, so you'll be able to write a

for

loop that handles most

items in a list one way but handles certain items with specific values in a dif-  
ferent way.

Chapter 5

**A Simple Example**

The following example shows how

if

tests let you respond to special situa-

tions correctly. Imagine you have a list of cars and you want to print out the   
name of each car. Car names are proper names, so the names of most cars   
should be printed in title case. However, the value

'bmw'

should be printed

in all uppercase. The following code loops through a list of car names and   
looks for the value

'bmw'

. Whenever the value is

'bmw'

, it's printed in upper-

case instead of title case:

*cars.py*

cars = \['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota'\]

for car in cars:

1

if car == 'bmw':

print(car.upper())  
else:  
print(car.title())

The loop in this example first checks if the current value of

car

is

'bmw'

1

.

If it is, the value is printed in uppercase. If the value of

car

is anything other

than

'bmw'

, it's printed in title case:

Audi  
BMW  
Subaru  
Toyota

This example combines a number of the concepts you'll learn about

in this chapter. Let's begin by looking at the kinds of tests you can use to   
examine the conditions in your program.

**Conditional Tests**

At the heart of every

if

statement is an expression that can be evaluated as

True

or

False

and is called a *conditional test*. Python uses the values

True

and

False

to decide whether the code in an

if

statement should be executed. If a

conditional test evaluates to

True

, Python executes the code following the

if

statement. If the test evaluates to

False

, Python ignores the code following

the

if

statement.

***Checking for Equality***

Most conditional tests compare the current value of a variable to a specific   
value of interest. The simplest conditional test checks whether the value of a   
variable is equal to the value of interest:

\>\>\>

**car = 'bmw'**

\>\>\>

**car == 'bmw'**

True  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress111.png)

if Statements

**73**

The first line sets the value of

car

to

'bmw'

using a single equal sign, as

you've seen many times already. The next line checks whether the value of

car

is

'bmw'

by using a double equal sign (

==

). This *equality operator* returns

True

if the values on the left and right side of the operator match, and

False

if

they don't match. The values in this example match, so Python returns

True

.

When the value of

car

is anything other than

'bmw'

, this test returns

False

:

\>\>\>

**car = 'audi'**

\>\>\>

**car == 'bmw'**

False

A single equal sign is really a statement; you might read the first line

of code here as "Set the value of

car

equal to

'audi'

." On the other hand, a

double equal sign asks a question: "Is the value of

car

equal to

'bmw'

?" Most

programming languages use equal signs in this way.

***Ignoring Case When Checking for Equality***

Testing for equality is case sensitive in Python. For example, two values with   
different capitalization are not considered equal:

\>\>\>

**car = 'Audi'**

\>\>\>

**car == 'audi'**

False

If case matters, this behavior is advantageous. But if case doesn't matter

and instead you just want to test the value of a variable, you can convert the   
variable's value to lowercase before doing the comparison:

\>\>\>

**car = 'Audi'**

\>\>\>

**car.lower() == 'audi'**

True

This test will return

True

no matter how the value

'Audi'

is formatted

because the test is now case insensitive. The

lower()

method doesn't change

the value that was originally stored in

car

, so you can do this kind of com-

parison without affecting the original variable:

\>\>\>

**car = 'Audi'**

\>\>\>

**car.lower() == 'audi'**

True  
\>\>\>

**car**

'Audi'

We first assign the capitalized string

'Audi'

to the variable

car

. Then,

we convert the value of

car

to lowercase and compare the lowercase value to

the string

'audi'

. The two strings match, so Python returns

True

. We can see

that the value stored in

car

has not been affected by the

lower()

method.

Websites enforce certain rules for the data that users enter in a manner

similar to this. For example, a site might use a conditional test like this to  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress112.png)

**74**

Chapter 5

ensure that every user has a truly unique username, not just a variation on   
the capitalization of another person's username. When someone submits a   
new username, that new username is converted to lowercase and compared   
to the lowercase versions of all existing usernames. During this check, a user-  
name like

'John'

will be rejected if any variation of

'john'

is already in use.

***Checking for Inequality***

When you want to determine whether two values are not equal, you can use   
the *inequality operator* (

!=

). Let's use another

if

statement to examine how to

use the inequality operator. We'll store a requested pizza topping in a vari-  
able and then print a message if the person did not order anchovies:

*toppings.py*

requested_topping = 'mushrooms'

if requested_topping != 'anchovies':  
print("Hold the anchovies!")

This code compares the value of

requested_topping

to the value

'anchovies'

.

If these two values do not match, Python returns

True

and executes the code

following the

if

statement. If the two values match, Python returns

False

and

does not run the code following the

if

statement.

Because the value of

requested_topping

is not

'anchovies'

, the

print()

function is executed:

Hold the anchovies!

Most of the conditional expressions you write will test for equality, but

sometimes you'll find it more efficient to test for inequality.

***Numerical Comparisons***

Testing numerical values is pretty straightforward. For example, the follow-  
ing code checks whether a person is 18 years old:

\>\>\>

**age = 18**

\>\>\>

**age == 18**

True

You can also test to see if two numbers are not equal. For example, the

following code prints a message if the given answer is not correct:

*magic*

*_number.py*

answer = 17  
if answer != 42:  
print("That is not the correct answer. Please try again!")

The conditional test passes, because the value of

answer

(

17

) is not equal

to

42

. Because the test passes, the indented code block is executed:

That is not the correct answer. Please try again!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress113.png)

if Statements

**75**

You can include various mathematical comparisons in your conditional

statements as well, such as less than, less than or equal to, greater than, and   
greater than or equal to:

\>\>\>

**age = 19**

\>\>\>

**age \< 21**

True  
\>\>\>

**age \<= 21**

True  
\>\>\>

**age \> 21**

False  
\>\>\>

**age \>= 21**

False

Each mathematical comparison can be used as part of an

if

statement,

which can help you detect the exact conditions of interest.

***Checking Multiple Conditions***

You may want to check multiple conditions at the same time. For example,   
sometimes you might need two conditions to be

True

to take an action.

Other times, you might be satisfied with just one condition being

True

. The

keywords

and

and

or

can help you in these situations.

**Using and to Check Multiple Conditions**

To check whether two conditions are both

True

simultaneously, use the key-

word

and

to combine the two conditional tests; if each test passes, the overall

expression evaluates to

True

. If either test fails or if both tests fail, the expres-

sion evaluates to

False

.

For example, you can check whether two people are both over 21 by

using the following test:

\>\>\>

**age_0 = 22**

\>\>\>

**age_1 = 18**

1

\>\>\>

**age_0 \>= 21 and age_1 \>= 21**

False

2

\>\>\>

**age_1 = 22**

\>\>\>

**age_0 \>= 21 and age_1 \>= 21**

True

First, we define two ages,

age_0

and

age_1

. Then we check whether both

ages are 21 or older

1

. The test on the left passes, but the test on the right

fails, so the overall conditional expression evaluates to

False

. We then change

age_1

to 22

2

. The value of

age_1

is now greater than 21, so both individual

tests pass, causing the overall conditional expression to evaluate as

True

.

To improve readability, you can use parentheses around the individual

tests, but they are not required. If you use parentheses, your test would look   
like this:

(age_0 \>= 21) and (age_1 \>= 21)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress114.png)

**76**

Chapter 5

**Using or to Check Multiple Conditions**

The keyword

or

allows you to check multiple conditions as well, but it passes

when either or both of the individual tests pass. An

or

expression fails only

when both individual tests fail.

Let's consider two ages again, but this time we'll look for only one per-

son to be over 21:

\>\>\>

**age_0 = 22**

\>\>\>

**age_1 = 18**

1

\>\>\>

**age_0 \>= 21 or age_1 \>= 21**

True

2

\>\>\>

**age_0 = 18**

\>\>\>

**age_0 \>= 21 or age_1 \>= 21**

False

We start with two age variables again. Because the test for

age_0

1

passes,

the overall expression evaluates to

True

. We then lower

age_0

to 18. In the final

test

2

, both tests now fail and the overall expression evaluates to

False

.

***Checking Whether a Value Is in a List***

Sometimes it's important to check whether a list contains a certain value   
before taking an action. For example, you might want to check whether a   
new username already exists in a list of current usernames before completing   
someone's registration on a website. In a mapping project, you might want to   
check whether a submitted location already exists in a list of known locations.

To find out whether a particular value is already in a list, use the key-

word

in

. Let's consider some code you might write for a pizzeria. We'll

make a list of toppings a customer has requested for a pizza and then check   
whether certain toppings are in the list.

\>\>\>

**requested_toppings = \['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple'\]**

\>\>\>

**'mushrooms' in requested_toppings**

True  
\>\>\>

**'pepperoni' in requested_toppings**

False

The keyword

in

tells Python to check for the existence of

'mushrooms'

and

'pepperoni'

in the list

requested_toppings

. This technique is quite power-

ful because you can create a list of essential values, and then easily check   
whether the value you're testing matches one of the values in the list.

***Checking Whether a Value Is Not in a List***

Other times, it's important to know if a value does not appear in a list. You   
can use the keyword

not

in this situation. For example, consider a list of

users who are banned from commenting in a forum. You can check whether   
a user has been banned before allowing that person to submit a comment:

*banned_users.py*

banned_users = \['andrew', 'carolina', 'david'\]  
user = 'marie'  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress115.png)

if Statements

**77**

if user not in banned_users:  
print(f"{user.title()}, you can post a response if you wish.")

The

if

statement here reads quite clearly. If the value of

user

is not in

the list

banned_users

, Python returns

True

and executes the indented line.

The user

'marie'

is not in the list

banned_users

, so she sees a message

inviting her to post a response:

Marie, you can post a response if you wish.

***Boolean Expressions***

As you learn more about programming, you'll hear the term *Boolean expression*   
at some point. A Boolean expression is just another name for a conditional   
test. A *Boolean value* is either

True

or

False

, just like the value of a conditional

expression after it has been evaluated.

Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such

as whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on   
a website:

game_active = True  
can_edit = False

Boolean values provide an efficient way to track the state of a program

or a particular condition that is important in your program.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**5-1. Conditional Tests:**

Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement

describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code   
should look something like this:

car = 'subaru'  
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")  
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")  
print(car == 'audi')

â¢ Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line

evaluates to

True

or

False

.

â¢ Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to

True

and another

5 tests evaluate to

False

.

**5-2. More Conditional Tests:**

You don't have to limit the number of tests you cre-

ate to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them   
to

*conditional_tests.py*

. Have at least one

True

and one

False

result for each of

the following:

â¢ Tests for equality and inequality with strings  
â¢ Tests using the

lower()

method

â¢ Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less

than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to

â¢ Tests using the

and

keyword and the

or

keyword

â¢ Test whether an item is in a list  
â¢ Test whether an item is not in a list

**if Statements**

When you understand conditional tests, you can start writing

if

statements.

Several different kinds of

if

statements exist, and your choice of which to

use depends on the number of conditions you need to test. You saw several   
examples of

if

statements in the discussion about conditional tests, but now

let's dig deeper into the topic.

***Simple if Statements***

The simplest kind of

if

statement has one test and one action:

if

*conditional_test*

:

*do something*

You can put any conditional test in the first line and just about any action

in the indented block following the test. If the conditional test evaluates to

True

, Python executes the code following the

if

statement. If the test evaluates

to

False

, Python ignores the code following the

if

statement.

Let's say we have a variable representing a person's age, and we want to

know if that person is old enough to vote. The following code tests whether   
the person can vote:

*voting.py*

age = 19  
if age \>= 18:  
print("You are old enough to vote!")

Python checks to see whether the value of

age

is greater than or equal

to 18. It is, so Python executes the indented

print()

call:

You are old enough to vote!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress117.png)

if Statements

**79**

Indentation plays the same role in

if

statements as it did in

for

loops. All

indented lines after an

if

statement will be executed if the test passes, and

the entire block of indented lines will be ignored if the test does not pass.

You can have as many lines of code as you want in the block follow-

ing the

if

statement. Let's add another line of output if the person is old

enough to vote, asking if the individual has registered to vote yet:

age = 19  
if age \>= 18:  
print("You are old enough to vote!")

print("Have you registered to vote yet?")

The conditional test passes, and both

print()

calls are indented, so both

lines are printed:

You are old enough to vote!  
Have you registered to vote yet?

If the value of

age

is less than 18, this program would produce no output.

***if-else Statements***

Often, you'll want to take one action when a conditional test passes and a dif-  
ferent action in all other cases. Python's

if

-

else

syntax makes this possible. An

if

-

else

block is similar to a simple

if

statement, but the

else

statement allows

you to define an action or set of actions that are executed when the condi-  
tional test fails.

We'll display the same message we had previously if the person is old

enough to vote, but this time we'll add a message for anyone who is not   
old enough to vote:

age = 17

1

if age \>= 18:  
print("You are old enough to vote!")  
print("Have you registered to vote yet?")

2

else:

print("Sorry, you are too young to vote.")  
print("Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!")

If the conditional test

1

passes, the first block of indented

print()

calls is executed. If the test evaluates to

False

, the

else

block

2

is executed.

Because

age

is less than 18 this time, the conditional test fails and the code

in the

else

block is executed:

Sorry, you are too young to vote.  
Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!

This code works because it has only two possible situations to evaluate:

a person is either old enough to vote or not old enough to vote. The

if

-

else

![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress118.png)

**80**

Chapter 5

structure works well in situations in which you want Python to always exe-  
cute one of two possible actions. In a simple

if-else

chain like this, one of

the two actions will always be executed.

***The if-elif-else Chain***

Often, you'll need to test more than two possible situations, and to evaluate   
these you can use Python's

if

-

elif

-

else

syntax. Python executes only one

block in an

if

-

elif

-

else

chain. It runs each conditional test in order, until

one passes. When a test passes, the code following that test is executed and   
Python skips the rest of the tests.

Many real-world situations involve more than two possible conditions.

For example, consider an amusement park that charges different rates for   
different age groups:

â¢

Admission for anyone under age 4 is free.

â¢

Admission for anyone between the ages of 4 and 18 is $25.

â¢

Admission for anyone age 18 or older is $40.

How can we use an

if

statement to determine a person's admission rate?

The following code tests for the age group of a person and then prints an   
admission price message:

*amusement*

*_park.py*

age = 12

1

if age \< 4:

print("Your admission cost is $0.")

2

elif age \< 18:

print("Your admission cost is $25.")

3

else:

print("Your admission cost is $40.")

The

if

test

1

checks whether a person is under 4 years old. When the

test passes, an appropriate message is printed and Python skips the rest of   
the tests. The

elif

line

2

is really another

if

test, which runs only if the

previous test failed. At this point in the chain, we know the person is at least   
4 years old because the first test failed. If the person is under 18, an appro-  
priate message is printed and Python skips the

else

block. If both the

if

and

elif

tests fail, Python runs the code in the

else

block

3

.

In this example the

if

test

1

evaluates to

False

, so its code block is not

executed. However, the

elif

test evaluates to

True

(12 is less than 18) so its

code is executed. The output is one sentence, informing the user of the   
admission cost:

Your admission cost is $25.

Any age greater than 17 would cause the first two tests to fail. In these

situations, the

else

block would be executed and the admission price would

be $40.

Rather than printing the admission price within the

if

-

elif

-

else

block,

it would be more concise to set just the price inside the

if

-

elif

-

else

chain  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress119.png)

if Statements

**81**

and then have a single

print()

call that runs after the chain has been

evaluated:

age = 12

if age \< 4:

price = 0

elif age \< 18:

price = 25

else:

price = 40

print(f"Your admission cost is ${price}.")

The indented lines set the value of

price

according to the person's age,

as in the previous example. After the price is set by the

if

-

elif

-

else

chain, a

separate unindented

print()

call uses this value to display a message report-

ing the person's admission price.

This code produces the same output as the previous example, but the

purpose of the

if

-

elif

-

else

chain is narrower. Instead of determining a price

and displaying a message, it simply determines the admission price. In addi-  
tion to being more efficient, this revised code is easier to modify than the   
original approach. To change the text of the output message, you would   
need to change only one

print()

call rather than three separate

print()

calls.

***Using Multiple elif Blocks***

You can use as many

elif

blocks in your code as you like. For example, if the

amusement park were to implement a discount for seniors, you could add   
one more conditional test to the code to determine whether someone quali-  
fies for the senior discount. Let's say that anyone 65 or older pays half the   
regular admission, or $20:

age = 12

if age \< 4:  
price = 0  
elif age \< 18:  
price = 25

elif age \< 65:  
price = 40  
else:  
price = 20

print(f"Your admission cost is ${price}.")

Most of this code is unchanged. The second

elif

block now checks to

make sure a person is less than age 65 before assigning them the full admis-  
sion rate of $40. Notice that the value assigned in the

else

block needs to

be changed to $20, because the only ages that make it to this block are for   
people 65 or older.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress120.png)

**82**

Chapter 5

***Omitting the else Block***

Python does not require an

else

block at the end of an

if

-

elif

chain.

Sometimes, an

else

block is useful. Other times, it's clearer to use an addi-

tional

elif

statement that catches the specific condition of interest:

age = 12

if age \< 4:  
price = 0  
elif age \< 18:  
price = 25  
elif age \< 65:  
price = 40

elif age \>= 65:  

price = 20

print(f"Your admission cost is ${price}.")

The final

elif

block assigns a price of $20 when the person is 65 or

older, which is a little clearer than the general

else

block. With this change,

every block of code must pass a specific test in order to be executed.

The

else

block is a catchall statement. It matches any condition that

wasn't matched by a specific

if

or

elif

test, and that can sometimes include

invalid or even malicious data. If you have a specific final condition you're   
testing for, consider using a final

elif

block and omit the

else

block. As a

result, you'll be more confident that your code will run only under the cor-  
rect conditions.

***Testing Multiple Conditions***

The

if

-

elif

-

else

chain is powerful, but it's only appropriate to use when you

just need one test to pass. As soon as Python finds one test that passes, it   
skips the rest of the tests. This behavior is beneficial, because it's efficient   
and allows you to test for one specific condition.

However, sometimes it's important to check all conditions of interest. In

this case, you should use a series of simple

if

statements with no

elif

or

else

blocks. This technique makes sense when more than one condition could   
be

True

, and you want to act on every condition that is

True

.

Let's reconsider the pizzeria example. If someone requests a two-topping

pizza, you'll need to be sure to include both toppings on their pizza:

*toppings.py*

requested_toppings = \['mushrooms', 'extra cheese'\]

if 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings:  
print("Adding mushrooms.")

1

if 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings:

print("Adding pepperoni.")  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress121.png)

if Statements

**83**

if 'extra cheese' in requested_toppings:  
print("Adding extra cheese.")

print("\\nFinished making your pizza!")

We start with a list containing the requested toppings. The first

if

statement checks to see whether the person requested mushrooms on their   
pizza. If so, a message is printed confirming that topping. The test for pep-  
peroni

1

is another simple

if

statement, not an

elif

or

else

statement, so

this test is run regardless of whether the previous test passed or not. The   
last

if

statement checks whether extra cheese was requested, regardless of

the results from the first two tests. These three independent tests are exe-  
cuted every time this program is run.

Because every condition in this example is evaluated, both mushrooms

and extra cheese are added to the pizza:

Adding mushrooms.  
Adding extra cheese.

Finished making your pizza!

This code would not work properly if we used an

if

-

elif

-

else

block,

because the code would stop running after only one test passes. Here's   
what that would look like:

requested_toppings = \['mushrooms', 'extra cheese'\]

if 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings:  
print("Adding mushrooms.")

elif 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings:  

print("Adding pepperoni.")

elif 'extra cheese' in requested_toppings:  

print("Adding extra cheese.")

print("\\nFinished making your pizza!")

The test for

'mushrooms'

is the first test to pass, so mushrooms are added

to the pizza. However, the values

'extra cheese'

and

'pepperoni'

are never

checked, because Python doesn't run any tests beyond the first test that   
passes in an

if-elif-else

chain. The customer's first topping will be added,

but all of their other toppings will be missed:

Adding mushrooms.

Finished making your pizza!

In summary, if you want only one block of code to run, use an

if

-

elif

-

else

chain. If more than one block of code needs to run, use a series of indepen-  
dent

if

statements.

**5-7. Favorite Fruit:**

Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of

independent

if

statements that check for certain fruits in your list.

â¢ Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it

favorite_fruits

.

â¢ Write five

if

statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit

is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the

if

block should print a statement,

such as

*You really like bananas!*

**Using if Statements with Lists**

You can do some interesting work when you combine lists and

if

statements.

You can watch for special values that need to be treated differently than   
other values in the list. You can efficiently manage changing conditions,   
such as the availability of certain items in a restaurant throughout a shift.   
You can also begin to prove that your code works as you expect it to in all   
possible situations.

***Checking for Special Items***

This chapter began with a simple example that showed how to handle a spe-  
cial value like

'bmw'

, which needed to be printed in a different format than

other values in the list. Now that you have a basic understanding of condi-  
tional tests and

if

statements, let's take a closer look at how you can watch

for special values in a list and handle those values appropriately.

Let's continue with the pizzeria example. The pizzeria displays a mes-

sage whenever a topping is added to your pizza, as it's being made. The code   
for this action can be written very efficiently by making a list of toppings the   
customer has requested and using a loop to announce each topping as it's   
added to the pizza:

*toppings.py*

requested_toppings = \['mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese'\]

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:  
print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.")

print("\\nFinished making your pizza!")

The output is straightforward because this code is just a simple

for

loop:

Adding mushrooms.  
Adding green peppers.  
Adding extra cheese.

Finished making your pizza!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress124.png)

**86**

Chapter 5

But what if the pizzeria runs out of green peppers? An

if

statement

inside the

for

loop can handle this situation appropriately:

requested_toppings = \['mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese'\]

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:

if requested_topping == 'green peppers':  
print("Sorry, we are out of green peppers right now.")  
else:  

print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.")

print("\\nFinished making your pizza!")

This time, we check each requested item before adding it to the pizza.

The

if

statement checks to see if the person requested green peppers. If so,

we display a message informing them why they can't have green peppers.   
The

else

block ensures that all other toppings will be added to the pizza.

The output shows that each requested topping is handled appropriately.

Adding mushrooms.  
Sorry, we are out of green peppers right now.  
Adding extra cheese.

Finished making your pizza!

***Checking That a List Is Not Empty***

We've made a simple assumption about every list we've worked with so far:   
we've assumed that each list has at least one item in it. Soon we'll let users   
provide the information that's stored in a list, so we won't be able to assume   
that a list has any items in it each time a loop is run. In this situation, it's   
useful to check whether a list is empty before running a

for

loop.

As an example, let's check whether the list of requested toppings is

empty before building the pizza. If the list is empty, we'll prompt the user   
and make sure they want a plain pizza. If the list is not empty, we'll build   
the pizza just as we did in the previous examples:

requested_toppings = \[\]

if requested_toppings:  

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:

print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.")  
print("\\nFinished making your pizza!")

else:  
print("Are you sure you want a plain pizza?")

This time we start out with an empty list of requested toppings. Instead

of jumping right into a

for

loop, we do a quick check first. When the name

of a list is used in an

if

statement, Python returns

True

if the list contains at

least one item; an empty list evaluates to

False

. If

requested_toppings

passes

the conditional test, we run the same

for

loop we used in the previous  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress125.png)

if Statements

**87**

example. If the conditional test fails, we print a message asking the cus-  
tomer if they really want a plain pizza with no toppings.

The list is empty in this case, so the output asks if the user really wants

a plain pizza:

Are you sure you want a plain pizza?

If the list is not empty, the output will show each requested topping

being added to the pizza.

***Using Multiple Lists***

People will ask for just about anything, especially when it comes to pizza   
toppings. What if a customer actually wants french fries on their pizza? You   
can use lists and

if

statements to make sure your input makes sense before

you act on it.

Let's watch out for unusual topping requests before we build a pizza.

The following example defines two lists. The first is a list of available top-  
pings at the pizzeria, and the second is the list of toppings that the user has   
requested. This time, each item in

requested_toppings

is checked against the

list of available toppings before it's added to the pizza:

available_toppings = \['mushrooms', 'olives', 'green peppers',  
'pepperoni', 'pineapple', 'extra cheese'\]

1

requested_toppings = \['mushrooms', 'french fries', 'extra cheese'\]

for requested_topping in requested_toppings:

2

if requested_topping in available_toppings:

print(f"Adding {requested_topping}.")

3

else:

print(f"Sorry, we don't have {requested_topping}.")

print("\\nFinished making your pizza!")

First, we define a list of available toppings at this pizzeria. Note that this

could be a tuple if the pizzeria has a stable selection of toppings. Then, we   
make a list of toppings that a customer has requested. There's an unusual   
request for a topping in this example:

'french fries'

1

. Next we loop

through the list of requested toppings. Inside the loop, we check to see if   
each requested topping is actually in the list of available toppings

2

. If it is,

we add that topping to the pizza. If the requested topping is not in the list   
of available toppings, the

else

block will run

3

. The

else

block prints a mes-

sage telling the user which toppings are unavailable.

This code syntax produces clean, informative output:

Adding mushrooms.  
Sorry, we don't have french fries.  
Adding extra cheese.

Finished making your pizza!

Chapter 5

In just a few lines of code, we've managed a real-world situation pretty

effectively!

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**5-8. Hello Admin:**

Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name

'admin'

. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user

after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to   
each user.

â¢ If the username is

'admin'

, print a special greeting, such as

*Hello admin,*

*would you like to see a status report?*

â¢ Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as

*Hello Jaden, thank you for*

*logging in again.*

**5-9. No Users:**

Add an

if

test to

*hello_admin.py*

to make sure the list of users is

not empty.

â¢ If the list is empty, print the message

*We need to find some users!*

â¢ Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct mes-

sage is printed.

**5-10. Checking Usernames:**

Do the following to create a program that simulates

how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.

â¢ Make a list of five or more usernames called

current_users

.

â¢ Make another list of five usernames called

new_users

. Make sure one or

two of the new usernames are also in the

current_users

list.

â¢ Loop through the

new_users

list to see if each new username has already

been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a   
new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying   
that the username is available.

â¢ Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If

'John'

has been used,

'JOHN'

should not be accepted. (To do this, you'll need to make a copy of

current_users

containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)

**5-11. Ordinal Numbers:**

Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a list, such as

*1st*

or

*2nd*

. Most ordinal numbers end in

*th*

, except 1, 2, and 3.

â¢ Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list.  
â¢ Loop through the list.  
â¢ Use an

if

-

elif

-

else

chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending

for each number. Your output should read

"1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th

8th 9th"

, and each result should be on a separate line.

**Styling Your if Statements**

In every example in this chapter, you've seen good styling habits. The only   
recommendation PEP 8 provides for styling conditional tests is to use a single   
space around comparison operators, such as

==

,

\>=

, and

\<=

. For example:

if age \< 4:

is better than:

if age\<4:

Such spacing does not affect the way Python interprets your code; it just

makes your code easier for you and others to read.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**5-12. Styling**

**if**

**Statements:**

Review the programs you wrote in this chapter, and

make sure you styled your conditional tests appropriately.

**5-13. Your Ideas:**

At this point, you're a more capable programmer than you

were when you started this book. Now that you have a better sense of how   
real-world situations are modeled in programs, you might be thinking of some   
problems you could solve with your own programs. Record any new ideas you   
have about problems you might want to solve as your programming skills con-  
tinue to improve. Consider games you might want to write, datasets you might   
want to explore, and web applications you'd like to create.

**Summary**

In this chapter you learned how to write conditional tests, which always   
evaluate to

True

or

False

. You learned to write simple

if

statements,

if

-

else

chains, and

if

-

elif

-

else

chains. You began using these structures to identify

particular conditions you need to test and to know when those conditions   
have been met in your programs. You learned to handle certain items in a   
list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency   
of a

for

loop. You also revisited Python's style recommendations to ensure

that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and   
understand.

I[n Chapter 6](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#129) you'll learn about Python's dictionaries. A dictionary is

similar to a list, but it allows you to connect pieces of information. You'll   
learn how to build dictionaries, loop through them, and use them in combi-  
nation with lists and

if

statements. Learning about dictionaries will enable

you to model an even wider variety of real-world situations.

**D I C T I O N A R I E S**

In this chapter you'll learn how to use

Python's dictionaries, which allow you to con-

nect pieces of related information. You'll learn

how to access the information once it's in a dic-

tionary and how to modify that information. Because   
dictionaries can store an almost limitless amount of

information, I'll show you how to loop through the data in a dictionary.   
Additionally, you'll learn to nest dictionaries inside lists, lists inside diction-  
aries, and even dictionaries inside other dictionaries.

Understanding dictionaries allows you to model a variety of real-world

objects more accurately. You'll be able to create a dictionary representing a   
person and then store as much information as you want about that person.   
You can store their name, age, location, profession, and any other aspect of   
a person you can describe. You'll be able to store any two kinds of informa-  
tion that can be matched up, such as a list of words and their meanings, a   
list of people's names and their favorite numbers, a list of mountains and   
their elevations, and so forth.

Chapter 6

**A Simple Dictionary**

Consider a game featuring aliens that can have different colors and point   
values. This simple dictionary stores information about a particular alien:

*alien.py*

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}

print(alien_0\['color'\])  
print(alien_0\['points'\])

The dictionary

alien_0

stores the alien's color and point value. The last

two lines access and display that information, as shown here:

green  
5

As with most new programming concepts, using dictionaries takes prac-

tice. Once you've worked with dictionaries for a bit, you'll see how effectively   
they can model real-world situations.

**Working with Dictionaries**

A *dictionary* in Python is a collection of *key-value pairs* . Each *key* is connected to   
a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A   
key's value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact,   
you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.

In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces (

{}

) with a series of key-value

pairs inside the braces, as shown in the earlier example:

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}

A *key-value pair* is a set of values associated with each other. When you

provide a key, Python returns the value associated with that key. Every key is   
connected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated   
by commas. You can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a dictionary.

The simplest dictionary has exactly one key-value pair, as shown in this

modified version of the

alien_0

dictionary:

alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}

This dictionary stores one piece of information about

alien_0

: the alien's

color. The string

'color'

is a key in this dictionary, and its associated value

is

'green'

.

***Accessing Values in a Dictionary***

To get the value associated with a key, give the name of the dictionary and   
then place the key inside a set of square brackets, as shown here:

*alien.py*

alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}

print(alien_0\['color'\])  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress131.png)

Dictionaries

**93**

This returns the value associated with the key

'color'

from the diction-

ary

alien_0

:

green

You can have an unlimited number of key-value pairs in a dictionary.

For example, here's the original

alien_0

dictionary with two key-value pairs:

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}

Now you can access either the color or the point value of

alien_0

. If a

player shoots down this alien, you can look up how many points they should   
earn using code like this:

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}

new_points = alien_0\['points'\]  
print(f"You just earned {new_points} points!")

Once the dictionary has been defined, we pull the value associated with

the key

'points'

from the dictionary. This value is then assigned to the vari-

able

new_points

. The last line prints a statement about how many points the

player just earned:

You just earned 5 points!

If you run this code every time an alien is shot down, the alien's point

value will be retrieved.

***Adding New Key-Value Pairs***

Dictionaries are dynamic structures, and you can add new key-value pairs   
to a dictionary at any time. To add a new key-value pair, you would give the   
name of the dictionary followed by the new key in square brackets, along   
with the new value.

Let's add two new pieces of information to the

alien_0

dictionary: the

alien's *x* - and *y* -coordinates, which will help us display the alien at a par-  
ticular position on the screen. Let's place the alien on the left edge of the   
screen, 25 pixels down from the top. Because screen coordinates usually   
start at the upper-left corner of the screen, we'll place the alien on the left   
edge of the screen by setting the *x* -coordinate to 0 and 25 pixels from the   
top by setting its *y*-coordinate to positive 25, as shown here:

*alien.py*

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}

print(alien_0)

alien_0\['x_position'\] = 0  
alien_0\['y_position'\] = 25  
print(alien_0)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress132.png)

**94**

Chapter 6

We start by defining the same dictionary that we've been working with.

We then print this dictionary, displaying a snapshot of its information.   
Next, we add a new key-value pair to the dictionary: the key

'x_position'

and the value

0

. We do the same for the key

'y_position'

. When we print the

modified dictionary, we see the two additional key-value pairs:

{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}  
{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'x_position': 0, 'y_position': 25}

The final version of the dictionary contains four key-value pairs. The

original two specify color and point value, and two more specify the alien's   
position.

Dictionaries retain the order in which they were defined. When you

print a dictionary or loop through its elements, you will see the elements in   
the same order they were added to the dictionary.

***Starting with an Empty Dictionary***

It's sometimes convenient, or even necessary, to start with an empty diction-  
ary and then add each new item to it. To start filling an empty dictionary,   
define a dictionary with an empty set of braces and then add each key-value   
pair on its own line. For example, here's how to build the

alien_0

dictionary

using this approach:

*alien.py*

alien_0 = {}

alien_0\['color'\] = 'green'  
alien_0\['points'\] = 5

print(alien_0)

We first define an empty

alien_0

dictionary, and then add color and

point values to it. The result is the dictionary we've been using in previous   
examples:

{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}

Typically, you'll use empty dictionaries when storing user-supplied data

in a dictionary or when writing code that generates a large number of key-  
value pairs automatically.

***Modifying Values in a Dictionary***

To modify a value in a dictionary, give the name of the dictionary with the   
key in square brackets and then the new value you want associated with   
that key. For example, consider an alien that changes from green to yellow   
as a game progresses:

*alien.py*

alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}  
print(f"The alien is {alien_0\['color'\]}.")  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress133.png)

Dictionaries

**95**

alien_0\['color'\] = 'yellow'  
print(f"The alien is now {alien_0\['color'\]}.")

We first define a dictionary for

alien_0

that contains only the alien's

color; then we change the value associated with the key

'color'

to

'yellow'

.

The output shows that the alien has indeed changed from green to yellow:

The alien is green.  
The alien is now yellow.

For a more interesting example, let's track the position of an alien that

can move at different speeds. We'll store a value representing the alien's   
current speed and then use it to determine how far to the right the alien   
should move:

alien_0 = {'x_position': 0, 'y_position': 25, 'speed': 'medium'}  
print(f"Original position: {alien_0\['x_position'\]}")

# Move the alien to the right.  
# Determine how far to move the alien based on its current speed.

1

if alien_0\['speed'\] == 'slow':

x_increment = 1  
elif alien_0\['speed'\] == 'medium':  
x_increment = 2  
else:  
# This must be a fast alien.  
x_increment = 3

# The new position is the old position plus the increment.

2

alien_0\['x_position'\] = alien_0\['x_position'\] + x_increment

print(f"New position: {alien_0\['x_position'\]}")

We start by defining an alien with an initial *x* position and *y* position,

and a speed of

'medium'

. We've omitted the color and point values for the

sake of simplicity, but this example would work the same way if you included   
those key-value pairs as well. We also print the original value of

x_position

to

see how far the alien moves to the right.

An

if

-

elif

-

else

chain determines how far the alien should move to

the right, and assigns this value to the variable

x_increment

1

. If the alien's

speed is

'slow'

, it moves one unit to the right; if the speed is

'medium'

, it

moves two units to the right; and if it's

'fast'

, it moves three units to the

right. Once the increment has been calculated, it's added to the value of

x_position

2

, and the result is stored in the dictionary's

x_position

.

Because this is a medium-speed alien, its position shifts two units to the

right:

Original x-position: 0  
New x-position: 2  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress134.png)

**96**

Chapter 6

This technique is pretty cool: by changing one value in the alien's dic-

tionary, you can change the overall behavior of the alien. For example, to   
turn this medium-speed alien into a fast alien, you would add this line:

alien_0\['speed'\] = 'fast'

The

if

-

elif

-

else

block would then assign a larger value to

x_increment

the next time the code runs.

***Removing Key-Value Pairs***

When you no longer need a piece of information that's stored in a diction-  
ary, you can use the

del

statement to completely remove a key-value pair.

All

del

needs is the name of the dictionary and the key that you want to

remove.

For example, let's remove the key

'points'

from the

alien_0

dictionary,

along with its value:

*alien.py*

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}  
print(alien_0)

1

del alien_0\['points'\]

print(alien_0)

The

del

statement

1

tells Python to delete the key

'points'

from the

dictionary

alien_0

and to remove the value associated with that key as well.

The output shows that the key

'points'

and its value of

5

are deleted from

the dictionary, but the rest of the dictionary is unaffected:

{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}  
{'color': 'green'}

**N O T E**

*Be aware that the deleted key-value pair is removed permanently.*

***A Dictionary of Similar Objects***

The previous example involved storing different kinds of information about   
one object, an alien in a game. You can also use a dictionary to store one   
kind of information about many objects. For example, say you want to poll a   
number of people and ask them what their favorite programming language   
is. A dictionary is useful for storing the results of a simple poll, like this:

*favorite*

*_languages.py*

favorite_languages = {  
'jen': 'python',  
'sarah': 'c',  
'edward': 'rust',  
'phil': 'python',  
}  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress135.png)

Dictionaries

**97**

As you can see, we've broken a larger dictionary into several lines. Each

key is the name of a person who responded to the poll, and each value is   
their language choice. When you know you'll need more than one line to   
define a dictionary, press ENTER after the opening brace. Then indent the   
next line one level (four spaces) and write the first key-value pair, followed   
by a comma. From this point forward when you press ENTER, your text edi-  
tor should automatically indent all subsequent key-value pairs to match the   
first key-value pair.

Once you've finished defining the dictionary, add a closing brace on a

new line after the last key-value pair, and indent it one level so it aligns with   
the keys in the dictionary. It's good practice to include a comma after the   
last key-value pair as well, so you're ready to add a new key-value pair on the   
next line.

*tionaries in a similar manner to this example. Other acceptable ways to format long
dictionaries are available as well, so you may see slightly different formatting in your
editor, or in other sources.*

To use this dictionary, given the name of a person who took the poll,

you can easily look up their favorite language:

*favorite*

*_languages.py*

favorite_languages = {  
'jen': 'python',  
'sarah': 'c',  
'edward': 'rust',  
'phil': 'python',  
}

1

language = favorite_languages\['sarah'\].title()

print(f"Sarah's favorite language is {language}.")

To see which language Sarah chose, we ask for the value at:

favorite_languages\['sarah'\]

We use this syntax to pull Sarah's favorite language from the dictionary

1

and assign it to the variable

language

. Creating a new variable here makes for a

much cleaner

print()

call. The output shows Sarah's favorite language:

Sarah's favorite language is C.

You could use this same syntax with any individual represented in the

dictionary.

***Using get() to Access Values***

Using keys in square brackets to retrieve the value you're interested in from a   
dictionary might cause one potential problem: if the key you ask for doesn't   
exist, you'll get an error.

Chapter 6

Let's see what happens when you ask for the point value of an alien that

doesn't have a point value set:

*alien_no*

*_points.py*

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'}  
print(alien_0\['points'\])

This results in a traceback, showing a

KeyError

:

Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "alien_no_points.py", line 2, in \<module\>  
print(alien_0\['points'\])  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^  
KeyError: 'points'

You'll learn more about how to handle errors like this in general in

[Chapter 10](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#221). For dictionaries specifically, you can use the

get()

method to set

a default value that will be returned if the requested key doesn't exist.

The

get()

method requires a key as a first argument. As a second optional

argument, you can pass the value to be returned if the key doesn't exist:

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'}

point_value = alien_0.get('points', 'No point value assigned.')  
print(point_value)

If the key

'points'

exists in the dictionary, you'll get the correspond-

ing value. If it doesn't, you get the default value. In this case,

points

doesn't

exist, and we get a clean message instead of an error:

No point value assigned.

If there's a chance the key you're asking for might not exist, consider

using the

get()

method instead of the square bracket notation.

**N O T E**

*If you leave out the second argument in the call to*

*get()*

*and the key doesn't exist,*

*Python will return the value*

*None*

*. The special value*

*None*

*means "no value exists."*

*This is not an error: it's a special value meant to indicate the absence of a value.

number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print   
each person's name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few   
friends and get some actual data for your program.

**6-3. Glossary:**

A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary.

However, to avoid confusion, let's call it a glossary.

â¢ Think of five programming words you've learned about in the previous

chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their   
meanings as values.

â¢ Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might

print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word   
on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the   
newline character (

\\n

) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning

pair in your output.

**Looping Through a Dictionary**

A single Python dictionary can contain just a few key-value pairs or millions   
of pairs. Because a dictionary can contain large amounts of data, Python   
lets you loop through a dictionary. Dictionaries can be used to store infor-  
mation in a variety of ways; therefore, several different ways exist to loop   
through them. You can loop through all of a dictionary's key-value pairs,   
through its keys, or through its values.

***Looping Through All Key-Value Pairs***

Before we explore the different approaches to looping, let's consider a new   
dictionary designed to store information about a user on a website. The   
following dictionary would store one person's username, first name, and   
last name:

*user.py*

user_0 = {  
'username': 'efermi',  
'first': 'enrico',  
'last': 'fermi',  
}

You can access any single piece of information about

user_0

based

on what you've already learned in this chapter. But what if you wanted to   
see everything stored in this user's dictionary? To do so, you could loop   
through the dictionary using a

for

loop:

user_0 = {  
'username': 'efermi',  
'first': 'enrico',  
'last': 'fermi',  
}  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress138.png)

**100**

Chapter 6

for key, value in user_0.items():  
print(f"\\nKey: {key}")  
print(f"Value: {value}")

To write a

for

loop for a dictionary, you create names for the two vari-

ables that will hold the key and value in each key-value pair. You can choose   
any names you want for these two variables. This code would work just as   
well if you had used abbreviations for the variable names, like this:

for k, v in user_0.items()

The second half of the

for

statement includes the name of the dictionary

followed by the method

items()

, which returns a sequence of key-value pairs.

The

for

loop then assigns each of these pairs to the two variables provided.

In the preceding example, we use the variables to print each

key

, followed

by the associated

value

. The

"\\n"

in the first

print()

call ensures that a blank

line is inserted before each key-value pair in the output:

Key: username  
Value: efermi

Key: first  
Value: enrico

Key: last  
Value: fermi

Looping through all key-value pairs works particularly well for diction-

aries like the *favorite_languages.py* example o[n page 96, w](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#134)hich stores the   
same kind of information for many different keys. If you loop through the

favorite_languages

dictionary, you get the name of each person in the dic-

tionary and their favorite programming language. Because the keys always   
refer to a person's name and the value is always a language, we'll use the   
variables

name

and

language

in the loop instead of

key

and

value

. This will

make it easier to follow what's happening inside the loop:

*favorite*

*_languages.py*

favorite_languages = {  
'jen': 'python',  
'sarah': 'c',  
'edward': 'rust',  
'phil': 'python',  
}

for name, language in favorite_languages.items():  
print(f"{name.title()}'s favorite language is {language.title()}.")

This code tells Python to loop through each key-value pair in the dic-

tionary. As it works through each pair the key is assigned to the variable

name

, and the value is assigned to the variable

language

. These descriptive

names make it much easier to see what the

print()

call is doing.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress139.png)

Dictionaries

**101**

Now, in just a few lines of code, we can display all of the information

from the poll:

Jen's favorite language is Python.  
Sarah's favorite language is C.  
Edward's favorite language is Rust.  
Phil's favorite language is Python.

This type of looping would work just as well if our dictionary stored the

results from polling a thousand or even a million people.

***Looping Through All the Keys in a Dictionary***

The

keys()

method is useful when you don't need to work with all of the val-

ues in a dictionary. Let's loop through the

favorite_languages

dictionary and

print the names of everyone who took the poll:

favorite_languages = {  
'jen': 'python',  
'sarah': 'c',  
'edward': 'rust',  
'phil': 'python',  
}

for name in favorite_languages.keys():  
print(name.title())

This

for

loop tells Python to pull all the keys from the dictionary

favorite

_languages

and assign them one at a time to the variable

name

. The output

shows the names of everyone who took the poll:

Jen  
Sarah  
Edward  
Phil

Looping through the keys is actually the default behavior when looping

through a dictionary, so this code would have exactly the same output if you   
wrote:

for name in favorite_languages:

rather than:

for name in favorite_languages.keys():

You can choose to use the

keys()

method explicitly if it makes your code

easier to read, or you can omit it if you wish.

You can access the value associated with any key you care about inside

the loop, by using the current key. Let's print a message to a couple of   
friends about the languages they chose. We'll loop through the names in  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress140.png)

**102**

Chapter 6

the dictionary as we did previously, but when the name matches one of our   
friends, we'll display a message about their favorite language:

favorite_languages = {  

*--snip--*

}

friends = \['phil', 'sarah'\]

for name in favorite_languages.keys():

print(f"Hi {name.title()}.")

1

if name in friends:

2

language = favorite_languages\[name\].title()

print(f"\\t{name.title()}, I see you love {language}!")

First, we make a list of friends that we want to print a message to. Inside

the loop, we print each person's name. Then we check whether the

name

we're working with is in the list

friends

1

. If it is, we determine the person's

favorite language using the name of the dictionary and the current value of

name

as the key

2

. We then print a special greeting, including a reference to

their language of choice.

Everyone's name is printed, but our friends receive a special message:

Hi Jen.  
Hi Sarah.  
Sarah, I see you love C!  
Hi Edward.  
Hi Phil.  
Phil, I see you love Python!

You can also use the

keys()

method to find out if a particular person

was polled. This time, let's find out if Erin took the poll:

favorite_languages = {  

*--snip--*

}

if 'erin' not in favorite_languages.keys():  
print("Erin, please take our poll!")

The

keys()

method isn't just for looping: it actually returns a sequence of

all the keys, and the

if

statement simply checks if

'erin'

is in this sequence.

Because she's not, a message is printed inviting her to take the poll:

Erin, please take our poll!

***Looping Through a Dictionary's Keys in a Particular Order***

Looping through a dictionary returns the items in the same order they   
were inserted. Sometimes, though, you'll want to loop through a dictionary   
in a different order.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress141.png)

Dictionaries

**103**

One way to do this is to sort the keys as they're returned in the

for

loop.

You can use the

sorted()

function to get a copy of the keys in order:

favorite_languages = {  
'jen': 'python',  
'sarah': 'c',  
'edward': 'rust',  
'phil': 'python',  
}

for name in sorted(favorite_languages.keys()):  
print(f"{name.title()}, thank you for taking the poll.")

This

for

statement is like other

for

statements, except that we've

wrapped the

sorted()

function around the

dictionary.keys()

method. This

tells Python to get all the keys in the dictionary and sort them before starting   
the loop. The output shows everyone who took the poll, with the names dis-  
played in order:

Edward, thank you for taking the poll.  
Jen, thank you for taking the poll.  
Phil, thank you for taking the poll.  
Sarah, thank you for taking the poll.

***Looping Through All Values in a Dictionary***

If you are primarily interested in the values that a dictionary contains, you   
can use the

values()

method to return a sequence of values without any

keys. For example, say we simply want a list of all languages chosen in our   
programming language poll, without the name of the person who chose   
each language:

favorite_languages = {  
'jen': 'python',  
'sarah': 'c',  
'edward': 'rust',  
'phil': 'python',  
}

print("The following languages have been mentioned:")  
for language in favorite_languages.values():  
print(language.title())

The

for

statement here pulls each value from the dictionary and assigns

it to the variable

language

. When these values are printed, we get a list of all

chosen languages:

The following languages have been mentioned:  
Python  
C  
Rust  
Python  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress142.png)

**104**

Chapter 6

This approach pulls all the values from the dictionary without check-

ing for repeats. This might work fine with a small number of values, but in a   
poll with a large number of respondents, it would result in a very repetitive   
list. To see each language chosen without repetition, we can use a set. A *set*   
is a collection in which each item must be unique:

favorite_languages = {  

*--snip--*

}

print("The following languages have been mentioned:")

for language in set(favorite_languages.values()):

print(language.title())

When you wrap

set()

around a collection of values that contains dupli-

cate items, Python identifies the unique items in the collection and builds a   
set from those items. Here we use

set()

to pull out the unique languages in

favorite_languages.values()

.

The result is a nonrepetitive list of languages that have been mentioned

by people taking the poll:

The following languages have been mentioned:  
Python  
C  
Rust

As you continue learning about Python, you'll often find a built-in feature

of the language that helps you do exactly what you want with your data.

**N O T E**

*You can build a set directly using braces and separating the elements with commas:*

\>\>\>

**languages = {'python', 'rust', 'python', 'c'}**

\>\>\>

**languages**

{'rust', 'python', 'c'}

*It's easy to mistake sets for dictionaries because they're both wrapped in braces.*

*When you see braces but no key-value pairs, you're probably looking at a set. Unlike
lists and dictionaries, sets do not retain items in any specific order.*

Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean

up the code from [Exercise 6-3 (page 99) b](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#137)y replacing your series of

print()

calls with a loop that runs through the dictionary's keys and values. When   
you're sure that your loop works, add five more Python terms to your glossary.   
When you run your program again, these new words and meanings should   
automatically be included in the output.

**6-5. Rivers:**

Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country

each river runs through. One key-value pair might be

â¢ Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as

*The Nile runs*

*through Egypt*

.

â¢ Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.  
â¢ Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.

**6-6. Polling:**

Use the code in

*favorite_languages.py*

([page 96](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#134)).

â¢ Make a list of people who should take the favorite languages poll. Include

some names that are already in the dictionary and some that are not.

â¢ Loop through the list of people who should take the poll. If they have

already taken the poll, print a message thanking them for responding.   
If they have not yet taken the poll, print a message inviting them to take   
the poll.

**Nesting**

Sometimes you'll want to store multiple dictionaries in a list, or a list of   
items as a value in a dictionary. This is called *nesting* . You can nest dictionar-  
ies inside a list, a list of items inside a dictionary, or even a dictionary inside   
another dictionary. Nesting is a powerful feature, as the following examples   
will demonstrate.

***A List of Dictionaries***

The

alien_0

dictionary contains a variety of information about one alien,

but it has no room to store information about a second alien, much less a   
screen full of aliens. How can you manage a fleet of aliens? One way is to   
make a list of aliens in which each alien is a dictionary of information about   
that alien. For example, the following code builds a list of three aliens:

*aliens.py*

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}  
alien_1 = {'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10}  
alien_2 = {'color': 'red', 'points': 15}

1

aliens = \[alien_0, alien_1, alien_2\]

for alien in aliens:  
print(alien)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress144.png)

**106**

Chapter 6

We first create three dictionaries, each representing a different alien.

We store each of these dictionaries in a list called

aliens

1

. Finally, we loop

through the list and print out each alien:

{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}  
{'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10}  
{'color': 'red', 'points': 15}

A more realistic example would involve more than three aliens with

code that automatically generates each alien. In the following example, we   
use

range()

to create a fleet of 30 aliens:

# Make an empty list for storing aliens.  
aliens = \[\]

# Make 30 green aliens.

1

for alien_number in range(30):

2

new_alien = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}

3

aliens.append(new_alien)

# Show the first 5 aliens.

4

for alien in aliens\[:5\]:

print(alien)  
print("...")

# Show how many aliens have been created.  
print(f"Total number of aliens: {len(aliens)}")

This example begins with an empty list to hold all of the aliens that will

be created. The

range()

function

1

returns a series of numbers, which just

tells Python how many times we want the loop to repeat. Each time the loop   
runs, we create a new alien

2

and then append each new alien to the list

aliens

3

. We use a slice to print the first five aliens

4

, and finally, we print

the length of the list to prove we've actually generated the full fleet of   
30 aliens:

{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}  
{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}  
{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}  
{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}  
{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}  
...

Total number of aliens: 30

These aliens all have the same characteristics, but Python considers each

one a separate object, which allows us to modify each alien individually.

How might you work with a group of aliens like this? Imagine that one

aspect of a game has some aliens changing color and moving faster as the   
game progresses. When it's time to change colors, we can use a

for

loop and

an

if

statement to change the color of the aliens. For example, to change  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress145.png)

Dictionaries

**107**

the first three aliens to yellow, medium-speed aliens worth 10 points each,   
we could do this:

# Make an empty list for storing aliens.  
aliens = \[\]

# Make 30 green aliens.  
for alien_number in range (30):  
new_alien = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}  
aliens.append(new_alien)

for alien in aliens\[:3\]:  
if alien\['color'\] == 'green':  
alien\['color'\] = 'yellow'  
alien\['speed'\] = 'medium'  
alien\['points'\] = 10

# Show the first 5 aliens.  
for alien in aliens\[:5\]:  
print(alien)  
print("...")

Because we want to modify the first three aliens, we loop through a

slice that includes only the first three aliens. All of the aliens are green now,   
but that won't always be the case, so we write an

if

statement to make sure

we're only modifying green aliens. If the alien is green, we change the color   
to

'yellow'

, the speed to

'medium'

, and the point value to

10

, as shown in the

following output:

{'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10, 'speed': 'medium'}  
{'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10, 'speed': 'medium'}  
{'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10, 'speed': 'medium'}  
{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}  
{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}  
...

You could expand this loop by adding an

elif

block that turns yellow

aliens into red, fast-moving ones worth 15 points each. Without showing the   
entire program again, that loop would look like this:

for alien in aliens\[0:3\]:  
if alien\['color'\] == 'green':  
alien\['color'\] = 'yellow'  
alien\['speed'\] = 'medium'  
alien\['points'\] = 10

elif alien\['color'\] == 'yellow':  
alien\['color'\] = 'red'  
alien\['speed'\] = 'fast'  
alien\['points'\] = 15

It's common to store a number of dictionaries in a list when each dic-

tionary contains many kinds of information about one object. For example,   
you might create a dictionary for each user on a website, as we did in *user.py*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress146.png)

**108**

Chapter 6

on[page 99](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#137), and store the individual dictionaries in a list called

users

. All

of the dictionaries in the list should have an identical structure, so you can   
loop through the list and work with each dictionary object in the same way.

***A List in a Dictionary***

Rather than putting a dictionary inside a list, it's sometimes useful to put   
a list inside a dictionary. For example, consider how you might describe a   
pizza that someone is ordering. If you were to use only a list, all you could   
really store is a list of the pizza's toppings. With a dictionary, a list of top-  
pings can be just one aspect of the pizza you're describing.

In the following example, two kinds of information are stored for each

pizza: a type of crust and a list of toppings. The list of toppings is a value   
associated with the key

'toppings'

. To use the items in the list, we give the

name of the dictionary and the key

'toppings'

, as we would any value in the

dictionary. Instead of returning a single value, we get a list of toppings:

*pizza.py*

# Store information about a pizza being ordered.  
pizza = {  
'crust': 'thick',  
'toppings': \['mushrooms', 'extra cheese'\],  
}

# Summarize the order.

1

print(f"You ordered a {pizza\['crust'\]}-crust pizza "

"with the following toppings:")

2

for topping in pizza\['toppings'\]:

print(f"\\t{topping}")

We begin with a dictionary that holds information about a pizza that

has been ordered. One key in the dictionary is

'crust'

, and the associated

value is the string

'thick'

. The next key,

'toppings'

, has a list as its value that

stores all requested toppings. We summarize the order before building the   
pizza

1

. When you need to break up a long line in a

print()

call, choose

an appropriate point at which to break the line being printed, and end the   
line with a quotation mark. Indent the next line, add an opening quotation   
mark, and continue the string. Python will automatically combine all of the   
strings it finds inside the parentheses. To print the toppings, we write a

for

loop

2

. To access the list of toppings, we use the key

'toppings'

, and Python

grabs the list of toppings from the dictionary.

The following output summarizes the pizza that we plan to build:

You ordered a thick-crust pizza with the following toppings:  
mushrooms  
extra cheese

You can nest a list inside a dictionary anytime you want more than one

value to be associated with a single key in a dictionary. In the earlier example   
of favorite programming languages, if we were to store each person's   
responses in a list, people could choose more than one favorite language.

Dictionaries

**109**

When we loop through the dictionary, the value associated with each per-  
son would be a list of languages rather than a single language. Inside the   
dictionary's

for

loop, we use another

for

loop to run through the list of lan-

guages associated with each person:

*favorite*

*_languages.py*

favorite_languages = {  
'jen': \['python', 'rust'\],  
'sarah': \['c'\],  
'edward': \['rust', 'go'\],  
'phil': \['python', 'haskell'\],  
}

1

for name, languages in favorite_languages.items():

print(f"\\n{name.title()}'s favorite languages are:")

2

for language in languages:

print(f"\\t{language.title()}")

The value associated with each name in

favorite_languages

is now a

list. Note that some people have one favorite language and others have   
multiple favorites. When we loop through the dictionary

1

, we use the

variable name

languages

to hold each value from the dictionary, because we

know that each value will be a list. Inside the main dictionary loop, we use   
another

for

loop

2

to run through each person's list of favorite languages.

Now each person can list as many favorite languages as they like:

Jen's favorite languages are:  
Python  
Rust

Sarah's favorite languages are:  
C

Edward's favorite languages are:  
Rust  
Go

Phil's favorite languages are:  
Python  
Haskell

To refine this program even further, you could include an

if

statement

at the beginning of the dictionary's

for

loop to see whether each person has

more than one favorite language by examining the value of

len(languages)

.

If a person has more than one favorite, the output would stay the same. If   
the person has only one favorite language, you could change the wording to   
reflect that. For example, you could say, "Sarah's favorite language is C."

*You should not nest lists and dictionaries too deeply. If you're nesting items much*

*deeper than what you see in the preceding examples, or if you're working with someone
else's code with significant levels of nesting, there's most likely a simpler way to solve
the problem.*

Chapter 6

***A Dictionary in a Dictionary***

You can nest a dictionary inside another dictionary, but your code can get   
complicated quickly when you do. For example, if you have several users   
for a website, each with a unique username, you can use the usernames as   
the keys in a dictionary. You can then store information about each user by   
using a dictionary as the value associated with their username. In the fol-  
lowing listing, we store three pieces of information about each user: their   
first name, last name, and location. We'll access this information by looping   
through the usernames and the dictionary of information associated with   
each username:

*many_users.py*

users = {  
'aeinstein': {  
'first': 'albert',  
'last': 'einstein',  
'location': 'princeton',  
},

'mcurie': {  
'first': 'marie',  
'last': 'curie',  
'location': 'paris',  
},

}

1

for username, user_info in users.items():

2

print(f"\\nUsername: {username}")

3

full_name = f"{user_info\['first'\]} {user_info\['last'\]}"

location = user_info\['location'\]

4

print(f"\\tFull name: {full_name.title()}")

print(f"\\tLocation: {location.title()}")

We first define a dictionary called

users

with two keys: one each for the

usernames

'aeinstein'

and

'mcurie'

. The value associated with each key is

a dictionary that includes each user's first name, last name, and location.   
Then, we loop through the

users

dictionary

1

. Python assigns each key to

the variable

username

, and the dictionary associated with each username is

assigned to the variable

user_info

. Once inside the main dictionary loop, we

print the username

2

.

Then, we start accessing the inner dictionary

3

. The variable

user_info

,

which contains the dictionary of user information, has three keys:

'first'

,

'last'

, and

'location'

. We use each key to generate a neatly formatted full

name and location for each person, and then print a summary of what we   
know about each user

4

:

Username: aeinstein  
Full name: Albert Einstein  
Location: Princeton  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress149.png)

Dictionaries

**111**

Username: mcurie  
Full name: Marie Curie  
Location: Paris

Notice that the structure of each user's dictionary is identical. Although

not required by Python, this structure makes nested dictionaries easier to   
work with. If each user's dictionary had different keys, the code inside the

for

loop would be more complicated.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**6-7. People:**

Start with the program you wrote for Exercise 6-[1 (page 98)](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#136). Make

two new dictionaries representing different people, and store all three dictionar-  
ies in a list called

people

. Loop through your list of people. As you loop through

the list, print everything you know about each person.

**6-8. Pets:**

Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a differ-

ent pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner's name.   
Store these dictionaries in a list called

pets

. Next, loop through your list and as

you do, print everything you know about each pet.

**6-9. Favorite Places:**

Make a dictionary called

favorite_places

. Think of three

names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for   
each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to   
name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each   
person's name and their favorite places.

**6-10. Favorite Numbers:**

Modify your program from Exercise 6-[2 (page 98) s](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#136)o

each person can have more than one favorite number. Then print each person's   
name along with their favorite numbers.

**6-11. Cities:**

Make a dictionary called

cities

. Use the names of three cities as

keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and   
include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact   
about that city. The keys for each city's dictionary should be something like

country

,

population

, and

fact

. Print the name of each city and all of the infor-

mation you have stored about it.

**6-12. Extensions:**

We're now working with examples that are complex enough

that they can be extended in any number of ways. Use one of the example pro-  
grams from this chapter, and extend it by adding new keys and values, chang-  
ing the context of the program, or improving the formatting of the output.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to define a dictionary and how to work with   
the information stored in a dictionary. You learned how to access and   
modify individual elements in a dictionary, and how to loop through all

of the information in a dictionary. You learned to loop through a diction-  
ary's key-value pairs, its keys, and its values. You also learned how to nest   
multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary   
inside a dictionary.

In the next chapter you'll learn about

while

loops and how to accept

input from people who are using your programs. This will be an exciting   
chapter, because you'll learn to make all of your programs interactive:   
they'll be able to respond to user input.

**U S E R I N P U T A N D W H I L E L O O P S**

Most programs are written to solve an end

user's problem. To do so, you usually need

to get some information from the user. For

example, say someone wants to find out whether

they're old enough to vote. If you write a program to   
answer this question, you need to know the user's age

before you can provide an answer. The program will need to ask the user   
to enter, or *input* , their age; once the program has this input, it can com-  
pare it to the voting age to determine if the user is old enough and then   
report the result.

In this chapter you'll learn how to accept user input so your program

can then work with it. When your program needs a name, you'll be able   
to prompt the user for a name. When your program needs a list of names,   
you'll be able to prompt the user for a series of names. To do this, you'll use   
the

input()

function.

You'll also learn how to keep programs running as long as users want

them to, so they can enter as much information as they need to; then, your  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress152.png)

**114**

Chapter 7

program can work with that information. You'll use Python's

while

loop to

keep programs running as long as certain conditions remain true.

With the ability to work with user input and the ability to control how

long your programs run, you'll be able to write fully interactive programs.

**How the input() Function Works**

The

input()

function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter

some text. Once Python receives the user's input, it assigns that input to a   
variable to make it convenient for you to work with.

For example, the following program asks the user to enter some text,

then displays that message back to the user:

*parrot.py*

message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")  
print(message)

The

input()

function takes one argument: the *prompt* that we want to

display to the user, so they know what kind of information to enter. In this   
example, when Python runs the first line, the user sees the prompt

Tell me

something, and I will repeat it back to you:

. The program waits while the

user enters their response and continues after the user presses ENTER. The   
response is assigned to the variable

message

, then

print(message)

displays the

input back to the user:

Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:

**Hello everyone!**

Hello everyone!

**N O T E**

*Some text editors won't run programs that prompt the user for input. You can use these*

*editors to write programs that prompt for input, but you'll need to run these programs
from a terminal. Se[e "Running Python Programs from a Terminal](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#49)* *" on [page 11.](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#49)*

***Writing Clear Prompts***

Each time you use the

input()

function, you should include a clear, easy-to-

follow prompt that tells the user exactly what kind of information you're   
looking for. Any statement that tells the user what to enter should work. For   
example:

*greeter.py*

name = input("Please enter your name: ")  
print(f"\\nHello, {name}!")

Add a space at the end of your prompts (after the colon in the preced-

ing example) to separate the prompt from the user's response and to make   
it clear to your user where to enter their text. For example:

Please enter your name:

**Eric**

Hello, Eric!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress153.png)

User Input and while Loops

**115**

Sometimes you'll want to write a prompt that's longer than one line.

For example, you might want to tell the user why you're asking for certain   
input. You can assign your prompt to a variable and pass that variable to the

input()

function. This allows you to build your prompt over several lines,

then write a clean

input()

statement.

*greeter.py*

prompt = "If you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see."  
prompt += "\\nWhat is your first name? "

name = input(prompt)

print(f"\\nHello, {name}!")

This example shows one way to build a multiline string. The first line

assigns the first part of the message to the variable

prompt

. In the second

line, the operator

+=

takes the string that was assigned to

prompt

and adds

the new string onto the end.

The prompt now spans two lines, again with space after the question

mark for clarity:

If you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see.  
What is your first name?

**Eric**

Hello, Eric!

***Using int() to Accept Numerical Input***

When you use the

input()

function, Python interprets everything the user

enters as a string. Consider the following interpreter session, which asks for   
the user's age:

\>\>\>

**age = input("How old are you? ")**

How old are you?

**21**

\>\>\>

**age**

'21'

The user enters the number

21

, but when we ask Python for the value of

age

, it returns

'21'

, the string representation of the numerical value entered.

We know Python interpreted the input as a string because the number is   
now enclosed in quotes. If all you want to do is print the input, this works   
well. But if you try to use the input as a number, you'll get an error:

\>\>\>

**age = input("How old are you? ")**

How old are you?

**21**

1

\>\>\>

**age \>= 18**

Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "\<stdin\>", line 1, in \<module\>

2

TypeError: '\>=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'

When you try to use the input to do a numerical comparison

1

, Python

produces an error because it can't compare a string to an integer: the string

'21'

that's assigned to

age

can't be compared to the numerical value

18

2

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress154.png)

**116**

Chapter 7

We can resolve this issue by using the

int()

function, which converts

the input string to a numerical value. This allows the comparison to run   
successfully:

\>\>\>

**age = input("How old are you? ")**

How old are you?

**21**

1

\>\>\>

**age = int(age)**

\>\>\>

**age \>= 18**

True

In this example, when we enter

21

at the prompt, Python interprets the

number as a string, but the value is then converted to a numerical represen-  
tation by

int()

1

. Now Python can run the conditional test: it compares

age

(which now represents the numerical value 21) and

18

to see if

age

is greater

than or equal to 18. This test evaluates to

True

.

How do you use the

int()

function in an actual program? Consider a

program that determines whether people are tall enough to ride a roller   
coaster:

*rollercoaster.py*

height = input("How tall are you, in inches? ")  
height = int(height)

if height \>= 48:  
print("\\nYou're tall enough to ride!")  
else:  
print("\\nYou'll be able to ride when you're a little older.")

The program can compare

height

to

48

because

height = int(height)

converts the input value to a numerical representation before the compari-  
son is made. If the number entered is greater than or equal to 48, we tell   
the user that they're tall enough:

How tall are you, in inches?

**71**

You're tall enough to ride!

When you use numerical input to do calculations and comparisons, be

sure to convert the input value to a numerical representation first.

***The Modulo Operator***

A useful tool for working with numerical information is the *modulo operator*(

%

),

which divides one number by another number and returns the remainder:

\>\>\>

**4 % 3**

1  
\>\>\>

**5 % 3**

2  
\>\>\>

**6 % 3**

0  
\>\>\>

**7 % 3**

1  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress155.png)

User Input and while Loops

**117**

The modulo operator doesn't tell you how many times one number fits

into another; it only tells you what the remainder is.

When one number is divisible by another number, the remainder is 0,

so the modulo operator always returns 0. You can use this fact to determine   
if a number is even or odd:

*even_or_odd.py*

number = input("Enter a number, and I'll tell you if it's even or odd: ")  
number = int(number)

if number % 2 == 0:  
print(f"\\nThe number {number} is even.")  
else:  
print(f"\\nThe number {number} is odd.")

Even numbers are always divisible by two, so if the modulo of a number

and two is zero (here,

if number % 2 == 0

) the number is even. Otherwise,

it's odd.

Enter a number, and I'll tell you if it's even or odd:

**42**

The number 42 is even.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**7-1. Rental Car:**

Write a program that asks the user what kind of rental car they

would like. Print a message about that car, such as "Let me see if I can find you   
a Subaru."

**7-2. Restaurant Seating:**

Write a program that asks the user how many people

are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message say-  
ing they'll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.

**7-3. Multiples of Ten:**

Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the

number is a multiple of 10 or not.

**Introducing while Loops**

The

for

loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once

for each item in the collection. In contrast, the

while

loop runs as long as, or

*while*, a certain condition is true.

***The while Loop in Action***

You can use a

while

loop to count up through a series of numbers. For example,

the following

while

loop counts from 1 to 5:

*counting.py*

current_number = 1  
while current_number \<= 5:  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress156.png)

**118**

Chapter 7

print(current_number)  
current_number += 1

In the first line, we start counting from 1 by assigning

current_number

the

value 1. The

while

loop is then set to keep running as long as the value of

current_number

is less than or equal to 5. The code inside the loop prints the

value of

current_number

and then adds 1 to that value with

current_number += 1

.

(The

+=

operator is shorthand for

current_number = current_number + 1

.)

Python repeats the loop as long as the condition

current_number \<= 5

is true. Because 1 is less than 5, Python prints

1

and then adds 1, making

the current number

2

. Because 2 is less than 5, Python prints

2

and adds 1

again, making the current number

3

, and so on. Once the value of

current

_number

is greater than 5, the loop stops running and the program ends:

1  
2  
3  
4  
5

The programs you use every day most likely contain

while

loops. For

example, a game needs a

while

loop to keep running as long as you want

to keep playing, and so it can stop running as soon as you ask it to quit.   
Programs wouldn't be fun to use if they stopped running before we told   
them to or kept running even after we wanted to quit, so

while

loops are

quite useful.

***Letting the User Choose When to Quit***

We can make the *parrot.py* program run as long as the user wants by putting   
most of the program inside a

while

loop. We'll define a *quit value* and then

keep the program running as long as the user has not entered the quit value:

*parrot.py*

prompt = "\\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"  
prompt += "\\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "

message = ""  
while message != 'quit':  
message = input(prompt)  
print(message)

We first define a prompt that tells the user their two options: entering

a message or entering the quit value (in this case,

'quit'

). Then we set up a

variable

message

to keep track of whatever value the user enters. We define

message

as an empty string,

""

, so Python has something to check the first

time it reaches the

while

line. The first time the program runs and Python

reaches the

while

statement, it needs to compare the value of

message

to

'quit'

, but no user input has been entered yet. If Python has nothing to

compare, it won't be able to continue running the program. To solve this  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress157.png)

User Input and while Loops

**119**

problem, we make sure to give

message

an initial value. Although it's just an

empty string, it will make sense to Python and allow it to perform the com-  
parison that makes the

while

loop work. This

while

loop runs as long as the

value of

message

is not

'quit'

.

The first time through the loop,

message

is just an empty string, so Python

enters the loop. At

message = input(prompt)

, Python displays the prompt and

waits for the user to enter their input. Whatever they enter is assigned to

message

and printed; then, Python reevaluates the condition in the

while

statement. As long as the user has not entered the word

'quit'

, the prompt

is displayed again and Python waits for more input. When the user finally   
enters

'quit'

, Python stops executing the

while

loop and the program ends:

Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:  
Enter 'quit' to end the program.

**Hello everyone!**

Hello everyone!

Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:  
Enter 'quit' to end the program.

**Hello again.**

Hello again.

Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:  
Enter 'quit' to end the program.

**quit**

quit

This program works well, except that it prints the word

'quit'

as if it

were an actual message. A simple

if

test fixes this:

prompt = "\\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"  
prompt += "\\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "

message = ""  
while message != 'quit':  
message = input(prompt)

if message != 'quit':  

print(message)

Now the program makes a quick check before displaying the message

and only prints the message if it does not match the quit value:

Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:  
Enter 'quit' to end the program.

**Hello everyone!**

Hello everyone!

Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:  
Enter 'quit' to end the program.

**Hello again.**

Hello again.

Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:  
Enter 'quit' to end the program.

**quit**

Chapter 7

***Using a Flag***

In the previous example, we had the program perform certain tasks while   
a given condition was true. But what about more complicated programs in   
which many different events could cause the program to stop running?

For example, in a game, several different events can end the game.

When the player runs out of ships, their time runs out, or the cities they   
were supposed to protect are all destroyed, the game should end. It needs   
to end if any one of these events happens. If many possible events might   
occur to stop the program, trying to test all these conditions in one

while

statement becomes complicated and difficult.

For a program that should run only as long as many conditions are

true, you can define one variable that determines whether or not the entire   
program is active. This variable, called a *flag* , acts as a signal to the pro-  
gram. We can write our programs so they run while the flag is set to

True

and stop running when any of several events sets the value of the flag to

False

. As a result, our overall

while

statement needs to check only one condi-

tion: whether the flag is currently

True

. Then, all our other tests (to see if an

event has occurred that should set the flag to

False

) can be neatly organized

in the rest of the program.

Let's add a flag to *parrot.py* from the previous section. This flag, which

we'll call

active

(though you can call it anything), will monitor whether or

not the program should continue running:

prompt = "\\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"  
prompt += "\\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "

active = True

1

while active:

message = input(prompt)

if message == 'quit':  
active = False  
else:  
print(message)

We set the variable

active

to

True

so the program starts in an active

state. Doing so makes the

while

statement simpler because no comparison is

made in the

while

statement itself; the logic is taken care of in other parts of

the program. As long as the

active

variable remains

True

, the loop will con-

tinue running

1

.

In the

if

statement inside the

while

loop, we check the value of

message

once the user enters their input. If the user enters

'quit'

, we set

active

to

False

, and the

while

loop stops. If the user enters anything other than

'quit'

,

we print their input as a message.

This program has the same output as the previous example where we

placed the conditional test directly in the

while

statement. But now that we

User Input and while Loops

**121**

have a flag to indicate whether the overall program is in an active state, it   
would be easy to add more tests (such as

elif

statements) for events that

should cause

active

to become

False

. This is useful in complicated programs

like games, in which there may be many events that should each make the   
program stop running. When any of these events causes the active flag to   
become

False

, the main game loop will exit, a *Game Over* message can be

displayed, and the player can be given the option to play again.

***Using break to Exit a Loop***

To exit a

while

loop immediately without running any remaining code in

the loop, regardless of the results of any conditional test, use the

break

state-

ment. The

break

statement directs the flow of your program; you can use it

to control which lines of code are executed and which aren't, so the program   
only executes code that you want it to, when you want it to.

For example, consider a program that asks the user about places they've

visited. We can stop the

while

loop in this program by calling

break

as soon

as the user enters the

'quit'

value:

*cities.py*

prompt = "\\nPlease enter the name of a city you have visited:"  
prompt += "\\n(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.) "

1

while True:

city = input(prompt)

if city == 'quit':  
break  
else:  
print(f"I'd love to go to {city.title()}!")

A loop that starts with

while True

1

will run forever unless it reaches a

break

statement. The loop in this program continues asking the user to enter

the names of cities they've been to until they enter

'quit'

. When they enter

'quit'

, the

break

statement runs, causing Python to exit the loop:

Please enter the name of a city you have visited:  
(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.)

**New York**

I'd love to go to New York!

Please enter the name of a city you have visited:  
(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.)

**San Francisco**

I'd love to go to San Francisco!

Please enter the name of a city you have visited:  
(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.)

**quit**

**N O T E**

*You can use the*

*break*

*statement in any of Python's loops. For example, you could use*

*break*

*to quit a*

*for*

*loop that's working through a list or a dictionary.*

Chapter 7

***Using continue in a Loop***

Rather than breaking out of a loop entirely without executing the rest of its   
code, you can use the

continue

statement to return to the beginning of the

loop, based on the result of a conditional test. For example, consider a loop   
that counts from 1 to 10 but prints only the odd numbers in that range:

*counting.py*

current_number = 0  
while current_number \< 10:

1

current_number += 1

if current_number % 2 == 0:  
continue

print(current_number)

First, we set

current_number

to 0. Because it's less than 10, Python enters

the

while

loop. Once inside the loop, we increment the count by 1

1

, so

current_number

is 1. The

if

statement then checks the modulo of

current_number

and 2. If the modulo is 0 (which means

current_number

is divisible by 2), the

continue

statement tells Python to ignore the rest of the loop and return to

the beginning. If the current number is not divisible by 2, the rest of the   
loop is executed and Python prints the current number:

1  
3  
5  
7  
9

***Avoiding Infinite Loops***

Every

while

loop needs a way to stop running so it won't continue to run for-

ever. For example, this counting loop should count from 1 to 5:

*counting.py*

x = 1  
while x \<= 5:  
print(x)  
x += 1

However, if you accidentally omit the line

x += 1

, the loop will run

forever:

# This loop runs forever!  
x = 1  
while x \<= 5:  
print(x)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress161.png)

User Input and while Loops

**123**

Now the value of

x

will start at

1

but never change. As a result, the con-

ditional test

x \<= 5

will always evaluate to

True

and the

while

loop will run

forever, printing a series of 1s, like this:

1  
1  
1  
1

*--snip--*

Every programmer accidentally writes an infinite

while

loop from time

to time, especially when a program's loops have subtle exit conditions. If   
your program gets stuck in an infinite loop, press CTRL-C or just close the   
terminal window displaying your program's output.

To avoid writing infinite loops, test every

while

loop and make sure the loop

stops when you expect it to. If you want your program to end when the user   
enters a certain input value, run the program and enter that value. If the   
program doesn't end, scrutinize the way your program handles the value that   
should cause the loop to exit. Make sure at least one part of the program can   
make the loop's condition

False

or cause it to reach a

break

statement.

Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of

pizza toppings until they enter a

'quit'

value. As they enter each topping, print

a message saying you'll add that topping to their pizza.

**7-5. Movie Tickets:**

A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on

a person's age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are   
between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is   
$15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost   
of their movie ticket.

Write different versions of either Exercise 7-4 or 7-5 that do

each of the following at least once:

â¢ Use a conditional test in the

while

statement to stop the loop.

â¢ Use an

active

variable to control how long the loop runs.

â¢ Use a

break

statement to exit the loop when the user enters a

value.

Chapter 7

**Using a while Loop with Lists and Dictionaries**

So far, we've worked with only one piece of user information at a time. We   
received the user's input and then printed the input or a response to it.   
The next time through the

while

loop, we'd receive another input value and

respond to that. But to keep track of many users and pieces of information,   
we'll need to use lists and dictionaries with our

while

loops.

A

for

loop is effective for looping through a list, but you shouldn't mod-

ify a list inside a

for

loop because Python will have trouble keeping track of

the items in the list. To modify a list as you work through it, use a

while

loop.

Using

while

loops with lists and dictionaries allows you to collect, store, and

organize lots of input to examine and report on later.

***Moving Items from One List to Another***

Consider a list of newly registered but unverified users of a website. After   
we verify these users, how can we move them to a separate list of confirmed   
users? One way would be to use a

while

loop to pull users from the list of

unconfirmed users as we verify them and then add them to a separate list of   
confirmed users. Here's what that code might look like:

*confirmed*

*_users.py*

# Start with users that need to be verified,  
# and an empty list to hold confirmed users.

1

unconfirmed_users = \['alice', 'brian', 'candace'\]

confirmed_users = \[\]

# Verify each user until there are no more unconfirmed users.  
# Move each verified user into the list of confirmed users.

2

while unconfirmed_users:

3

current_user = unconfirmed_users.pop()

print(f"Verifying user: {current_user.title()}")

4

confirmed_users.append(current_user)

# Display all confirmed users.  
print("\\nThe following users have been confirmed:")  
for confirmed_user in confirmed_users:  
print(confirmed_user.title())

We begin with a list of unconfirmed users

1

(Alice, Brian, and Candace)

and an empty list to hold confirmed users. The

while

loop runs as long as

the list

unconfirmed_users

is not empty

2

. Within this loop, the

pop()

method

removes unverified users one at a time from the end of

unconfirmed_users

3

.

Because Candace is last in the

unconfirmed_users

list, her name will be the

first to be removed, assigned to

current_user

, and added to the

confirmed_users

list

4

. Next is Brian, then Alice.

We simulate confirming each user by printing a verification message

and then adding them to the list of confirmed users. As the list of uncon-  
firmed users shrinks, the list of confirmed users grows. When the list of

User Input and while Loops

**125**

unconfirmed users is empty, the loop stops and the list of confirmed users   
is printed:

Verifying user: Candace  
Verifying user: Brian  
Verifying user: Alice

The following users have been confirmed:  
Candace  
Brian  
Alice

***Removing All Instances of Specific Values from a List***

I[n Chapter 3,](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#71) we used

remove()

to remove a specific value from a list. The

remove()

function worked because the value we were interested in appeared

only once in the list. But what if you want to remove all instances of a value   
from a list?

Say you have a list of pets with the value

'cat'

repeated several times. To

remove all instances of that value, you can run a

while

loop until

'cat'

is no

longer in the list, as shown here:

*pets.py*

pets = \['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat'\]  
print(pets)

while 'cat' in pets:  
pets.remove('cat')

print(pets)

We start with a list containing multiple instances of

'cat'

. After printing

the list, Python enters the

while

loop because it finds the value

'cat'

in the list

at least once. Once inside the loop, Python removes the first instance of

'cat'

,

returns to the

while

line, and then reenters the loop when it finds that

'cat'

is

still in the list. It removes each instance of

'cat'

until the value is no longer in

the list, at which point Python exits the loop and prints the list again:

\['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat'\]  
\['dog', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'rabbit'\]

***Filling a Dictionary with User Input***

You can prompt for as much input as you need in each pass through a

while

loop. Let's make a polling program in which each pass through the loop   
prompts for the participant's name and response. We'll store the data we   
gather in a dictionary, because we want to connect each response with a   
particular user:

*mountain_poll.py*

responses = {}  
# Set a flag to indicate that polling is active.  
polling_active = True  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress164.png)

**126**

Chapter 7

while polling_active:  
# Prompt for the person's name and response.

1

name = input("\\nWhat is your name? ")

response = input("Which mountain would you like to climb someday? ")

# Store the response in the dictionary.

2

responses\[name\] = response

# Find out if anyone else is going to take the poll.

3

repeat = input("Would you like to let another person respond? (yes/ no) ")

if repeat == 'no':  
polling_active = False

# Polling is complete. Show the results.  
print("\\n--- Poll Results ---")

4

for name, response in responses.items():

print(f"{name} would like to climb {response}.")

The program first defines an empty dictionary (

responses

) and sets a flag

(

polling_active

) to indicate that polling is active. As long as

polling_active

is

True

, Python will run the code in the

while

loop.

Within the loop, the user is prompted to enter their name and a moun-

tain they'd like to climb

1

. That information is stored in the

responses

dictionary

2

, and the user is asked whether or not to keep the poll run-

ning

3

. If they enter

yes

, the program enters the

while

loop again. If they

enter

no

, the

polling_active

flag is set to

False

, the

while

loop stops running,

and the final code block

4

displays the results of the poll.

If you run this program and enter sample responses, you should see

output like this:

What is your name?

**Eric**

Which mountain would you like to climb someday?

**Denali**

Would you like to let another person respond? (yes/ no)

**yes**

What is your name?

**Lynn**

Which mountain would you like to climb someday?

**Devil's Thumb**

Would you like to let another person respond? (yes/ no)

**no**

--- Poll Results ---  
Eric would like to climb Denali.  
Lynn would like to climb Devil's Thumb.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**7-8. Deli:**

Make a list called

sandwich_orders

and fill it with the names of various

sandwiches. Then make an empty list called

finished_sandwiches

. Loop through

the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such as

. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list of finished

sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing   
each sandwich that was made.

**7-9. No Pastrami:**

Using the list

sandwich_orders

from Exercise 7-8, make sure

the sandwich

'pastrami'

appears in the list at least three times. Add code

near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has   
run out of pastrami, and then use a

while

loop to remove all occurrences of

'pastrami'

from

sandwich_orders

. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up

in

finished_sandwiches

.

Write a program that polls users about their dream vaca-

tion. Write a prompt similar to

*If you could visit one place in the world, where*

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to use

input()

to allow users to provide

their own information in your programs. You learned to work with both   
text and numerical input and how to use

while

loops to make your programs

run as long as your users want them to. You saw several ways to control the   
flow of a

while

loop by setting an

active

flag, using the

break

statement, and

using the

continue

statement. You learned how to use a

while

loop to move

items from one list to another and how to remove all instances of a value   
from a list. You also learned how

while

loops can be used with dictionaries.

I[n Chapter 8](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#167) you'll learn about functions. *Functions* allow you to break

your programs into small parts, each of which does one specific job. You   
can call a function as many times as you want, and you can store your   
functions in separate files. By using functions, you'll be able to write more   
efficient code that's easier to troubleshoot and maintain and that can be   
reused in many different programs.

**F U N C T I O N S**

In this chapter you'll learn to write *func-*

*tions*, which are named blocks of code

designed to do one specific job. When you

want to perform a particular task that you've

defined in a function, you *call* the function respon-  
sible for it. If you need to perform that task multiple   
times throughout your program, you don't need to   
type all the code for the same task again and again;

you just call the function dedicated to handling that task, and the call   
tells Python to run the code inside the function. You'll find that using   
functions makes your programs easier to write, read, test, and fix.

In this chapter you'll also learn a variety of ways to pass information to

functions. You'll learn how to write certain functions whose primary job is   
to display information and other functions designed to process data and   
return a value or set of values. Finally, you'll learn to store functions in sep-  
arate files called *modules* to help organize your main program files.

Chapter 8

**Defining a Function**

Here's a simple function named

greet_user()

that prints a greeting:

*greeter.py*

def greet_user():  
"""Display a simple greeting."""  
print("Hello!")

greet_user()

This example shows the simplest structure of a function. The first line

uses the keyword

def

to inform Python that you're defining a function. This

is the *function definition* , which tells Python the name of the function and, if   
applicable, what kind of information the function needs to do its job. The   
parentheses hold that information. In this case, the name of the function is

greet_user()

, and it needs no information to do its job, so its parentheses are

empty. (Even so, the parentheses are required.) Finally, the definition ends   
in a colon.

Any indented lines that follow

def greet_user():

make up the *body* of the

function. The text on the second line is a comment called a *docstring* , which   
describes what the function does. When Python generates documentation   
for the functions in your programs, it looks for a string immediately after   
the function's definition. These strings are usually enclosed in triple quotes,   
which lets you write multiple lines.

The line

print("Hello!")

is the only line of actual code in the body of

this function, so

greet_user()

has just one job:

print("Hello!")

.

When you want to use this function, you have to call it. A *function call*

tells Python to execute the code in the function. To *call* a function, you write   
the name of the function, followed by any necessary information in paren-  
theses. Because no information is needed here, calling our function is as   
simple as entering

greet_user()

. As expected, it prints

Hello!

:

Hello!

***Passing Information to a Function***

If you modify the function

greet_user()

slightly, it can greet the user by

name. For the function to do this, you enter

username

in the parentheses of

the function's definition at

def greet_user()

. By adding

username

here, you

allow the function to accept any value of

username

you specify. The function

now expects you to provide a value for

username

each time you call it. When

you call

greet_user()

, you can pass it a name, such as

'jesse'

, inside the

parentheses:

def greet_user(username):  

"""Display a simple greeting."""

print(f"Hello, {username.title()}!")

greet_user('jesse')  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress169.png)

Functions

**131**

Entering

greet_user('jesse')

calls

greet_user()

and gives the function the

information it needs to execute the

print()

call. The function accepts the

name you passed it and displays the greeting for that name:

Hello, Jesse!

Likewise, entering

greet_user('sarah')

calls

greet_user()

, passes it

'sarah'

,

and prints

Hello, Sarah!

You can call

greet_user()

as often as you want and

pass it any name you want to produce a predictable output every time.

***Arguments and Parameters***

In the preceding

greet_user()

function, we defined

greet_user()

to require a

value for the variable

username

. Once we called the function and gave it the

information (a person's name), it printed the right greeting.

The variable

username

in the definition of

greet_user()

is an example of a

*parameter*, a piece of information the function needs to do its job. The value

'jesse'

in

greet_user('jesse')

is an example of an argument. An *argument* is

a piece of information that's passed from a function call to a function.   
When we call the function, we place the value we want the function to work   
with in parentheses. In this case the argument

'jesse'

was passed to the

function

greet_user()

, and the value was assigned to the parameter

username

.

**N O T E**

*People sometimes speak of arguments and parameters interchangeably. Don't be sur-*

*prised if you see the variables in a function definition referred to as arguments or the
variables in a function call referred to as parameters.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**8-1. Message:**

Write a function called

display_message()

that prints one sen-

tence telling everyone what you are learning about in this chapter. Call the   
function, and make sure the message displays correctly.

**8-2. Favorite Book:**

Write a function called

favorite_book()

that accepts one

parameter,

title

. The function should print a message, such as

One of my

favorite books is Alice in Wonderland

. Call the function, making sure to

include a book title as an argument in the function call.

**Passing Arguments**

Because a function definition can have multiple parameters, a function call   
may need multiple arguments. You can pass arguments to your functions   
in a number of ways. You can use *positional arguments* , which need to be in   
the same order the parameters were written; *keyword arguments* , where each   
argument consists of a variable name and a value; and lists and dictionaries   
of values. Let's look at each of these in turn.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress170.png)

**132**

Chapter 8

***Positional Arguments***

When you call a function, Python must match each argument in the func-  
tion call with a parameter in the function definition. The simplest way to   
do this is based on the order of the arguments provided. Values matched   
up this way are called *positional arguments*.

To see how this works, consider a function that displays information

about pets. The function tells us what kind of animal each pet is and the   
pet's name, as shown here:

*pets.py*

1

def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):

"""Display information about a pet."""  
print(f"\\nI have a {animal_type}.")  
print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

2

describe_pet('hamster', 'harry')

The definition shows that this function needs a type of animal and the

animal's name

1

. When we call

describe_pet()

, we need to provide an ani-

mal type and a name, in that order. For example, in the function call, the   
argument

'hamster'

is assigned to the parameter

animal_type

and the argu-

ment

'harry'

is assigned to the parameter

pet_name

2

. In the function body,

these two parameters are used to display information about the pet being   
described.

The output describes a hamster named Harry:

I have a hamster.  
My hamster's name is Harry.

**Multiple Function Calls**

You can call a function as many times as needed. Describing a second, dif-  
ferent pet requires just one more call to

describe_pet()

:

def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):  
"""Display information about a pet."""  
print(f"\\nI have a {animal_type}.")  
print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

describe_pet('hamster', 'harry')

describe_pet('dog', 'willie')

In this second function call, we pass

describe_pet()

the arguments

'dog'

and

'willie'

. As with the previous set of arguments we used, Python matches

'dog'

with the parameter

animal_type

and

'willie'

with the parameter

pet_name

.

As before, the function does its job, but this time it prints values for a dog   
named Willie. Now we have a hamster named Harry and a dog named Willie:

I have a hamster.  
My hamster's name is Harry.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress171.png)

Functions

**133**

I have a dog.  
My dog's name is Willie.

Calling a function multiple times is a very efficient way to work. The

code describing a pet is written once in the function. Then, anytime you   
want to describe a new pet, you call the function with the new pet's infor-  
mation. Even if the code for describing a pet were to expand to 10 lines, you   
could still describe a new pet in just one line by calling the function again.

**Order Matters in Positional Arguments**

You can get unexpected results if you mix up the order of the arguments in   
a function call when using positional arguments:

def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):  
"""Display information about a pet."""  
print(f"\\nI have a {animal_type}.")  
print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

describe_pet('harry', 'hamster')

In this function call, we list the name first and the type of animal

second. Because the argument

'harry'

is listed first this time, that value

is assigned to the parameter

animal_type

. Likewise,

'hamster'

is assigned to

pet_name

. Now we have a "harry" named "Hamster":

I have a harry.  
My harry's name is Hamster.

If you get funny results like this, check to make sure the order of the

arguments in your function call matches the order of the parameters in the   
function's definition.

***Keyword Arguments***

A *keyword argument* is a name-value pair that you pass to a function. You   
directly associate the name and the value within the argument, so when you   
pass the argument to the function, there's no confusion (you won't end up   
with a harry named Hamster). Keyword arguments free you from having   
to worry about correctly ordering your arguments in the function call, and   
they clarify the role of each value in the function call.

Let's rewrite *pets.py* using keyword arguments to call

describe_pet()

:

def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):  
"""Display information about a pet."""  
print(f"\\nI have a {animal_type}.")  
print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

describe_pet(animal_type='hamster', pet_name='harry')

Chapter 8

The function

describe_pet()

hasn't changed. But when we call the func-

tion, we explicitly tell Python which parameter each argument should be   
matched with. When Python reads the function call, it knows to assign the   
argument

'hamster'

to the parameter

animal_type

and the argument

'harry'

to

pet_name

. The output correctly shows that we have a hamster named Harry.

The order of keyword arguments doesn't matter because Python

knows where each value should go. The following two function calls are   
equivalent:

describe_pet(animal_type='hamster', pet_name='harry')  
describe_pet(pet_name='harry', animal_type='hamster')

**N O T E**

*When you use keyword arguments, be sure to use the exact names of the parameters in*

*the function's definition.*

***Default Values***

When writing a function, you can define a *default value* for each parameter.   
If an argument for a parameter is provided in the function call, Python   
uses the argument value. If not, it uses the parameter's default value. So   
when you define a default value for a parameter, you can exclude the cor-  
responding argument you'd usually write in the function call. Using default   
values can simplify your function calls and clarify the ways your functions   
are typically used.

For example, if you notice that most of the calls to

describe_pet()

are

being used to describe dogs, you can set the default value of

animal_type

to

'dog'

. Now anyone calling

describe_pet()

for a dog can omit that information:

def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):  

"""Display information about a pet."""

print(f"\\nI have a {animal_type}.")  
print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

describe_pet(pet_name='willie')

We changed the definition of

describe_pet()

to include a default value,

'dog'

, for

animal_type

. Now when the function is called with no

animal_type

specified, Python knows to use the value

'dog'

for this parameter:

I have a dog.  
My dog's name is Willie.

Note that the order of the parameters in the function definition had

to be changed. Because the default value makes it unnecessary to specify a   
type of animal as an argument, the only argument left in the function call   
is the pet's name. Python still interprets this as a positional argument, so   
if the function is called with just a pet's name, that argument will match up   
with the first parameter listed in the function's definition. This is the reason   
the first parameter needs to be

pet_name

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress173.png)

Functions

**135**

The simplest way to use this function now is to provide just a dog's

name in the function call:

describe_pet('willie')

This function call would have the same output as the previous example.

The only argument provided is

'willie'

, so it is matched up with the first

parameter in the definition,

pet_name

. Because no argument is provided for

animal_type

, Python uses the default value

'dog'

.

To describe an animal other than a dog, you could use a function call

like this:

describe_pet(pet_name='harry', animal_type='hamster')

Because an explicit argument for

animal_type

is provided, Python will

ignore the parameter's default value.

**N O T E**

*When you use default values, any parameter with a default value needs to be listed*

*after all the parameters that don't have default values. This allows Python to con-
tinue interpreting positional arguments correctly.*

***Equivalent Function Calls***

Because positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default values can   
all be used together, you'll often have several equivalent ways to call a func-  
tion. Consider the following definition for

describe_pet()

with one default

value provided:

def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):

With this definition, an argument always needs to be provided for

pet_name

, and this value can be provided using the positional or keyword for-

mat. If the animal being described is not a dog, an argument for

animal_type

must be included in the call, and this argument can also be specified using   
the positional or keyword format.

All of the following calls would work for this function:

# A dog named Willie.  
describe_pet('willie')  
describe_pet(pet_name='willie')

# A hamster named Harry.  
describe_pet('harry', 'hamster')  
describe_pet(pet_name='harry', animal_type='hamster')  
describe_pet(animal_type='hamster', pet_name='harry')

Each of these function calls would have the same output as the previous

examples.

It doesn't really matter which calling style you use. As long as your func-

tion calls produce the output you want, just use the style you find easiest to   
understand.

Chapter 8

***Avoiding Argument Errors***

When you start to use functions, don't be surprised if you encounter errors   
about unmatched arguments. Unmatched arguments occur when you   
provide fewer or more arguments than a function needs to do its work.   
For example, here's what happens if we try to call

describe_pet()

with no

arguments:

def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):  
"""Display information about a pet."""  
print(f"\\nI have a {animal_type}.")  
print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

describe_pet()

Python recognizes that some information is missing from the function

call, and the traceback tells us that:

Traceback (most recent call last):

1

File "pets.py", line 6, in \<module\>

2

describe_pet()

\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

3

TypeError: describe_pet() missing 2 required positional arguments:

'animal_type' and 'pet_name'

The traceback first tells us the location of the problem

1

, allowing us

to look back and see that something went wrong in our function call. Next,   
the offending function call is written out for us to see

2

. Last, the trace-

back tells us the call is missing two arguments and reports the names of   
the missing arguments

3

. If this function were in a separate file, we could

probably rewrite the call correctly without having to open that file and read   
the function code.

Python is helpful in that it reads the function's code for us and tells us

the names of the arguments we need to provide. This is another motiva-  
tion for giving your variables and functions descriptive names. If you do,   
Python's error messages will be more useful to you and anyone else who   
might use your code.

If you provide too many arguments, you should get a similar traceback

that can help you correctly match your function call to the function definition.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**8-3. T-Shirt:**

Write a function called

make_shirt()

that accepts a size and the

text of a message that should be printed on the shirt. The function should print a   
sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it.

Call the function once using positional arguments to make a shirt. Call the

function a second time using keyword arguments.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress175.png)

Functions

**137**

**8-4. Large Shirts:**

Modify the

make_shirt()

function so that shirts are large

by default with a message that reads

*I love Python*

. Make a large shirt and a

medium shirt with the default message, and a shirt of any size with a different   
message.

**8-5. Cities:**

Write a function called

describe_city()

that accepts the name of

a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as

Reykjavik is in Iceland

. Give the parameter for the country a default value.

Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the   
default country.

**Return Values**

A function doesn't always have to display its output directly. Instead, it can   
process some data and then return a value or set of values. The value the   
function returns is called a *return value*. The

return

statement takes a value

from inside a function and sends it back to the line that called the func-  
tion. Return values allow you to move much of your program's grunt   
work into functions, which can simplify the body of your program.

***Returning a Simple Value***

Let's look at a function that takes a first and last name, and returns a neatly   
formatted full name:

*formatted*

*_name.py*

def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):  
"""Return a full name, neatly formatted."""

1

full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"

2

return full_name.title()

3

musician = get_formatted_name('jimi', 'hendrix')

print(musician)

The definition of

get_formatted_name()

takes as parameters a first and

last name. The function combines these two names, adds a space between   
them, and assigns the result to

full_name

1

. The value of

full_name

is con-

verted to title case, and then returned to the calling line

2

.

When you call a function that returns a value, you need to provide a

variable that the return value can be assigned to. In this case, the returned   
value is assigned to the variable

musician

3

. The output shows a neatly for-

matted name made up of the parts of a person's name:

Jimi Hendrix

This might seem like a lot of work to get a neatly formatted name when

we could have just written:

print("Jimi Hendrix")  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress176.png)

**138**

Chapter 8

However, when you consider working with a large program that needs

to store many first and last names separately, functions like

get_formatted

_name()

become very useful. You store first and last names separately and

then call this function whenever you want to display a full name.

***Making an Argument Optional***

Sometimes it makes sense to make an argument optional, so that people   
using the function can choose to provide extra information only if they   
want to. You can use default values to make an argument optional.

For example, say we want to expand

get_formatted_name()

to handle

middle names as well. A first attempt to include middle names might look   
like this:

def get_formatted_name(first_name, middle_name, last_name):  
"""Return a full name, neatly formatted."""  
full_name = f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}"  
return full_name.title()

musician = get_formatted_name('john', 'lee', 'hooker')  
print(musician)

This function works when given a first, middle, and last name. The

function takes in all three parts of a name and then builds a string out of   
them. The function adds spaces where appropriate and converts the full   
name to title case:

John Lee Hooker

But middle names aren't always needed, and this function as written

would not work if you tried to call it with only a first name and a last name.   
To make the middle name optional, we can give the

middle_name

argument

an empty default value and ignore the argument unless the user provides a   
value. To make

get_formatted_name()

work without a middle name, we set the

default value of

middle_name

to an empty string and move it to the end of the

list of parameters:

def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name, middle_name=''):  

"""Return a full name, neatly formatted."""

1

if middle_name:

full_name = f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}"

2

else:

full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"  

return full_name.title()

musician = get_formatted_name('jimi', 'hendrix')  
print(musician)

3

musician = get_formatted_name('john', 'hooker', 'lee')

print(musician)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress177.png)

Functions

**139**

In this example, the name is built from three possible parts. Because

there's always a first and last name, these parameters are listed first in the   
function's definition. The middle name is optional, so it's listed last in the   
definition, and its default value is an empty string.

In the body of the function, we check to see if a middle name has been

provided. Python interprets non-empty strings as

True

, so the conditional

test

if middle_name

evaluates to

True

if a middle name argument is in the

function call

1

. If a middle name is provided, the first, middle, and last

names are combined to form a full name. This name is then changed to   
title case and returned to the function call line, where it's assigned to the   
variable

musician

and printed. If no middle name is provided, the empty

string fails the

if

test and the

else

block runs

2

. The full name is made

with just a first and last name, and the formatted name is returned to the   
calling line where it's assigned to

musician

and printed.

Calling this function with a first and last name is straightforward. If

we're using a middle name, however, we have to make sure the middle   
name is the last argument passed so Python will match up the positional   
arguments correctly

3

.

This modified version of our function works for people with just a first

and last name, and it works for people who have a middle name as well:

Jimi Hendrix  
John Lee Hooker

Optional values allow functions to handle a wide range of use cases

while letting function calls remain as simple as possible.

***Returning a Dictionary***

A function can return any kind of value you need it to, including more com-  
plicated data structures like lists and dictionaries. For example, the follow-  
ing function takes in parts of a name and returns a dictionary representing   
a person:

*person.py*

def build_person(first_name, last_name):  
"""Return a dictionary of information about a person."""

1

person = {'first': first_name, 'last': last_name}

2

return person

musician = build_person('jimi', 'hendrix')

3

print(musician)

The function

build_person()

takes in a first and last name, and puts

these values into a dictionary

1

. The value of

first_name

is stored with the

key

'first'

, and the value of

last_name

is stored with the key

'last'

. Then,

the entire dictionary representing the person is returned

2

. The return

value is printed

3

with the original two pieces of textual information now

stored in a dictionary:

{'first': 'jimi', 'last': 'hendrix'}  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress178.png)

**140**

Chapter 8

This function takes in simple textual information and puts it into a

more meaningful data structure that lets you work with the information   
beyond just printing it. The strings

'jimi'

and

'hendrix'

are now labeled as

a first name and last name. You can easily extend this function to accept   
optional values like a middle name, an age, an occupation, or any other   
information you want to store about a person. For example, the following   
change allows you to store a person's age as well:

def build_person(first_name, last_name, age=None):

"""Return a dictionary of information about a person."""  
person = {'first': first_name, 'last': last_name}

if age:  
person\['age'\] = age

return person

musician = build_person('jimi', 'hendrix', age=27)

print(musician)

We add a new optional parameter

age

to the function definition and

assign the parameter the special value

None

, which is used when a variable

has no specific value assigned to it. You can think of

None

as a placeholder

value. In conditional tests,

None

evaluates to

False

. If the function call

includes a value for

age

, that value is stored in the dictionary. This function

always stores a person's name, but it can also be modified to store any other   
information you want about a person.

***Using a Function with a while Loop***

You can use functions with all the Python structures you've learned about   
so far. For example, let's use the

get_formatted_name()

function with a

while

loop to greet users more formally. Here's a first attempt at greeting people   
using their first and last names:

*greeter.py*

def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):  
"""Return a full name, neatly formatted."""  
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"  
return full_name.title()

# This is an infinite loop!  
while True:

1

print("\\nPlease tell me your name:")

f_name = input("First name: ")  
l_name = input("Last name: ")

formatted_name = get_formatted_name(f_name, l_name)  
print(f"\\nHello, {formatted_name}!")

For this example, we use a simple version of

get_formatted_name()

that

doesn't involve middle names. The

while

loop asks the user to enter their

name, and we prompt for their first and last name separately

1

.

But there's one problem with this

while

loop: We haven't defined a quit

condition. Where do you put a quit condition when you ask for a series of  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress179.png)

Functions

**141**

inputs? We want the user to be able to quit as easily as possible, so each   
prompt should offer a way to quit. The

break

statement offers a straightfor-

ward way to exit the loop at either prompt:

def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):  
"""Return a full name, neatly formatted."""  
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"  
return full_name.title()

while True:  
print("\\nPlease tell me your name:")  

print("(enter 'q' at any time to quit)")

f_name = input("First name: ")  

if f_name == 'q':

break

l_name = input("Last name: ")  

if l_name == 'q':

break

formatted_name = get_formatted_name(f_name, l_name)  
print(f"\\nHello, {formatted_name}!")

We add a message that informs the user how to quit, and then we break

out of the loop if the user enters the quit value at either prompt. Now the pro-  
gram will continue greeting people until someone enters

q

for either name:

Please tell me your name:  
(enter 'q' at any time to quit)  
First name:

**eric**

Last name:

**matthes**

Hello, Eric Matthes!

Please tell me your name:  
(enter 'q' at any time to quit)  
First name:

**q**

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**8-6. City Names:**

Write a function called

"Santiago, Chile"

Call your function with at least three city-country pairs, and print the values

that are returned.

Chapter 8

**8-7. Album:**

Write a function called

make_album()

that builds a dictionary

describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an   
album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of   
information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different   
albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the   
album information correctly.

Use

None

to add an optional parameter to

make_album()

that allows you to

store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value for   
the number of songs, add that value to the album's dictionary. Make at least   
one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.

**8-8. User Albums:**

Start with your program from Exercise 8-7. Write a

while

loop that allows users to enter an album's artist and title. Once you have that   
information, call

make_album()

with the user's input and print the dictionary

that's created. Be sure to include a quit value in the

while

loop.

**Passing a List**

You'll often find it useful to pass a list to a function, whether it's a list of   
names, numbers, or more complex objects, such as dictionaries. When you   
pass a list to a function, the function gets direct access to the contents of   
the list. Let's use functions to make working with lists more efficient.

Say we have a list of users and want to print a greeting to each. The

following example sends a list of names to a function called

greet_users()

,

which greets each person in the list individually:

*greet_users.py*

def greet_users(names):  
"""Print a simple greeting to each user in the list."""  
for name in names:  
msg = f"Hello, {name.title()}!"  
print(msg)

usernames = \['hannah', 'ty', 'margot'\]  
greet_users(usernames)

We define

greet_users()

so it expects a list of names, which it assigns

to the parameter

names

. The function loops through the list it receives and

prints a greeting to each user. Outside of the function, we define a list of   
users and then pass the list

usernames

to

greet_users()

in the function call:

Hello, Hannah!  
Hello, Ty!  
Hello, Margot!

This is the output we wanted. Every user sees a personalized greeting,

and you can call the function anytime you want to greet a specific set of   
users.

Functions

**143**

***Modifying a List in a Function***

When you pass a list to a function, the function can modify the list. Any   
changes made to the list inside the function's body are permanent, allowing   
you to work efficiently even when you're dealing with large amounts of data.

Consider a company that creates 3D printed models of designs that

users submit. Designs that need to be printed are stored in a list, and after   
being printed they're moved to a separate list. The following code does this   
without using functions:

*printing*

*_models.py*

# Start with some designs that need to be printed.  
unprinted_designs = \['phone case', 'robot pendant', 'dodecahedron'\]  
completed_models = \[\]

# Simulate printing each design, until none are left.  
# Move each design to completed_models after printing.  
while unprinted_designs:  
current_design = unprinted_designs.pop()  
print(f"Printing model: {current_design}")  
completed_models.append(current_design)

# Display all completed models.  
print("\\nThe following models have been printed:")  
for completed_model in completed_models:  
print(completed_model)

This program starts with a list of designs that need to be printed and

an empty list called

completed_models

that each design will be moved to after

it has been printed. As long as designs remain in

unprinted_designs

, the

while

loop simulates printing each design by removing a design from the end of   
the list, storing it in

current_design

, and displaying a message that the cur-

rent design is being printed. It then adds the design to the list of completed   
models. When the loop is finished running, a list of the designs that have   
been printed is displayed:

Printing model: dodecahedron  
Printing model: robot pendant  
Printing model: phone case

The following models have been printed:  
dodecahedron  
robot pendant  
phone case

We can reorganize this code by writing two functions, each of which

does one specific job. Most of the code won't change; we're just structuring   
it more carefully. The first function will handle printing the designs, and   
the second will summarize the prints that have been made:

1

def print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models):

"""  
Simulate printing each design, until none are left.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress182.png)

**144**

Chapter 8

Move each design to completed_models after printing.  
"""  

while unprinted_designs:

current_design = unprinted_designs.pop()

print(f"Printing model: {current_design}")

completed_models.append(current_design)

2

def show_completed_models(completed_models):

"""Show all the models that were printed."""  

print("\\nThe following models have been printed:")

for completed_model in completed_models:

print(completed_model)

unprinted_designs = \['phone case', 'robot pendant', 'dodecahedron'\]  
completed_models = \[\]

print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models)  
show_completed_models(completed_models)

We define the function

print_models()

with two parameters: a list of

designs that need to be printed and a list of completed models

1

. Given

these two lists, the function simulates printing each design by emptying the   
list of unprinted designs and filling up the list of completed models. We   
then define the function

show_completed_models()

with one parameter: the list

of completed models

2

. Given this list,

show_completed_models()

displays the

name of each model that was printed.

This program has the same output as the version without functions, but

the code is much more organized. The code that does most of the work has   
been moved to two separate functions, which makes the main part of the   
program easier to understand. Look at the body of the program and notice   
how easily you can follow what's happening:

unprinted_designs = \['phone case', 'robot pendant', 'dodecahedron'\]  
completed_models = \[\]

print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models)  
show_completed_models(completed_models)

We set up a list of unprinted designs and an empty list that will hold the

completed models. Then, because we've already defined our two functions,   
all we have to do is call them and pass them the right arguments. We call

print_models()

and pass it the two lists it needs; as expected,

print_models()

simulates printing the designs. Then we call

show_completed_models()

and

pass it the list of completed models so it can report the models that have   
been printed. The descriptive function names allow others to read this code   
and understand it, even without comments.

This program is easier to extend and maintain than the version with-

out functions. If we need to print more designs later on, we can simply call  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress183.png)

Functions

**145**

print_models()

again. If we realize the printing code needs to be modified,

we can change the code once, and our changes will take place everywhere   
the function is called. This technique is more efficient than having to   
update code separately in several places in the program.

This example also demonstrates the idea that every function should

have one specific job. The first function prints each design, and the second   
displays the completed models. This is more beneficial than using one func-  
tion to do both jobs. If you're writing a function and notice the function   
is doing too many different tasks, try to split the code into two functions.   
Remember that you can always call a function from another function,   
which can be helpful when splitting a complex task into a series of steps.

***Preventing a Function from Modifying a List***

Sometimes you'll want to prevent a function from modifying a list. For   
example, say that you start with a list of unprinted designs and write a   
function to move them to a list of completed models, as in the previous   
example. You may decide that even though you've printed all the designs,   
you want to keep the original list of unprinted designs for your records. But   
because you moved all the design names out of

unprinted_designs

, the list is

now empty, and the empty list is the only version you have; the original is   
gone. In this case, you can address this issue by passing the function a copy   
of the list, not the original. Any changes the function makes to the list will   
affect only the copy, leaving the original list intact.

You can send a copy of a list to a function like this:

*function_name*

(

*list_name*

\[:\])

The slice notation

\[:\]

makes a copy of the list to send to the function. If

we didn't want to empty the list of unprinted designs in *printing_models.py* ,   
we could call

print_models()

like this:

print_models(unprinted_designs\[:\], completed_models)

The function

print_models()

can do its work because it still receives the

names of all unprinted designs. But this time it uses a copy of the original   
unprinted designs list, not the actual

unprinted_designs

list. The list

completed

_models

will fill up with the names of printed models like it did before, but

the original list of unprinted designs will be unaffected by the function.

Even though you can preserve the contents of a list by passing a copy

of it to your functions, you should pass the original list to functions unless   
you have a specific reason to pass a copy. It's more efficient for a function to   
work with an existing list, because this avoids using the time and memory   
needed to make a separate copy. This is especially true when working with   
large lists.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**8-9. Messages:**

Make a list containing a series of short text messages. Pass the

list to a function called

show_messages()

, which prints each text message.

**8-10. Sending Messages:**

Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9.

Write a function called

send_messages()

that prints each text message and

moves each message to a new list called

sent_messages

as it's printed. After

calling the function, print both of your lists to make sure the messages were   
moved correctly.

**8-11. Archived Messages:**

Start with your work from Exercise 8-10. Call the func-

tion

send_messages()

with a copy of the list of messages. After calling the func-

tion, print both of your lists to show that the original list has retained its messages.

**Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments**

Sometimes you won't know ahead of time how many arguments a function   
needs to accept. Fortunately, Python allows a function to collect an arbi-  
trary number of arguments from the calling statement.

For example, consider a function that builds a pizza. It needs to accept a

number of toppings, but you can't know ahead of time how many toppings a   
person will want. The function in the following example has one parameter,

\*toppings

, but this parameter collects as many arguments as the calling line

provides:

*pizza.py*

def make_pizza(\*toppings):  
"""Print the list of toppings that have been requested."""  
print(toppings)

make_pizza('pepperoni')  
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

The asterisk in the parameter name

\*toppings

tells Python to make a

tuple called

toppings

, containing all the values this function receives. The

print()

call in the function body produces output showing that Python can

handle a function call with one value and a call with three values. It treats   
the different calls similarly. Note that Python packs the arguments into a   
tuple, even if the function receives only one value:

('pepperoni',)  
('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

Now we can replace the

print()

call with a loop that runs through the

list of toppings and describes the pizza being ordered:

def make_pizza(\*toppings):  

"""Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress185.png)

Functions

**147**

print("\\nMaking a pizza with the following toppings:")  
for topping in toppings:  
print(f"- {topping}")

make_pizza('pepperoni')  
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

The function responds appropriately, whether it receives one value or

three values:

Making a pizza with the following toppings:  
- pepperoni

Making a pizza with the following toppings:  
- mushrooms  
- green peppers  
- extra cheese

This syntax works no matter how many arguments the function receives.

***Mixing Positional and Arbitrary Arguments***

If you want a function to accept several different kinds of arguments, the   
parameter that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments must be placed   
last in the function definition. Python matches positional and keyword   
arguments first and then collects any remaining arguments in the final   
parameter.

For example, if the function needs to take in a size for the pizza, that

parameter must come before the parameter

\*toppings

:

def make_pizza(size, \*toppings):  

"""Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""

print(f"\\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")  

for topping in toppings:

print(f"- {topping}")

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')  
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

In the function definition, Python assigns the first value it receives to

the parameter

size

. All other values that come after are stored in the tuple

toppings

. The function calls include an argument for the size first, followed

by as many toppings as needed.

Now each pizza has a size and a number of toppings, and each piece of

information is printed in the proper place, showing size first and toppings   
after:

Making a 16-inch pizza with the following toppings:  
- pepperoni

*\*args*

*, which collects arbitrary positional*

*arguments like this.*

***Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments***

Sometimes you'll want to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, but you   
won't know ahead of time what kind of information will be passed to the   
function. In this case, you can write functions that accept as many key-value   
pairs as the calling statement provides. One example involves building user   
profiles: you know you'll get information about a user, but you're not sure   
what kind of information you'll receive. The function

build_profile()

in the

following example always takes in a first and last name, but it accepts an   
arbitrary number of keyword arguments as well:

*user_profile.py*

def build_profile(first, last, \*\*user_info):  
"""Build a dictionary containing everything we know about a user."""

1

user_info\['first_name'\] = first

user_info\['last_name'\] = last  
return user_info

user_profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein',  
location='princeton',  
field='physics')  
print(user_profile)

The definition of

build_profile()

expects a first and last name, and then

it allows the user to pass in as many name-value pairs as they want. The   
double asterisks before the parameter

\*\*user_info

cause Python to create

a dictionary called

user_info

containing all the extra name-value pairs the

function receives. Within the function, you can access the key-value pairs in

user_info

just as you would for any dictionary.

In the body of

build_profile()

, we add the first and last names to the

user_info

dictionary because we'll always receive these two pieces of infor-

mation from the user

1

, and they haven't been placed into the dictionary

yet. Then we return the

user_info

dictionary to the function call line.

We call

build_profile()

, passing it the first name

'albert'

, the last

name

'einstein'

, and the two key-value pairs

location='princeton'

and

field='physics'

. We assign the returned

profile

to

user_profile

and print

user_profile

:

{'location': 'princeton', 'field': 'physics',  
'first_name': 'albert', 'last_name': 'einstein'}

The returned dictionary contains the user's first and last names and, in

this case, the location and field of study as well. The function will work no   
matter how many additional key-value pairs are provided in the function call.

Functions

You can mix positional, keyword, and arbitrary values in many differ-

ent ways when writing your own functions. It's useful to know that all these   
argument types exist because you'll see them often when you start reading   
other people's code. It takes practice to use the different types correctly   
and to know when to use each type. For now, remember to use the simplest   
approach that gets the job done. As you progress, you'll learn to use the   
most efficient approach each time.

**N O T E**

*You'll often see the parameter name*

*\*\*kwargs*

*used to collect nonspecific keyword*

*arguments.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**8-12. Sandwiches:**

Write a function that accepts a list of items a person wants

on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many   
items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sand-  
wich that's being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different num-  
ber of arguments each time.

**8-13. User Profile:**

Start with a copy of

*user_profile.py*

from[page 148](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#186). Build a

profile of yourself by calling

build_profile()

, using your first and last names

and three other key-value pairs that describe you.

**8-14. Cars:**

Write a function that stores information about a car in a diction-

ary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It   
should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the func-  
tion with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a   
color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:

car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)

Print the dictionary that's returned to make sure all the information was

stored correctly.

**Storing Your Functions in Modules**

One advantage of functions is the way they separate blocks of code from   
your main program. When you use descriptive names for your functions,   
your programs become much easier to follow. You can go a step further by   
storing your functions in a separate file called a *module* and then *importing*   
that module into your main program. An

import

statement tells Python to

make the code in a module available in the currently running program file.

Storing your functions in a separate file allows you to hide the details of

your program's code and focus on its higher-level logic. It also allows you to   
reuse functions in many different programs. When you store your functions   
in separate files, you can share those files with other programmers without  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress188.png)

**150**

Chapter 8

having to share your entire program. Knowing how to import functions   
also allows you to use libraries of functions that other programmers have   
written.

There are several ways to import a module, and I'll show you each of

these briefly.

***Importing an Entire Module***

To start importing functions, we first need to create a module. A *module* is   
a file ending in *.py* that contains the code you want to import into your pro-  
gram. Let's make a module that contains the function

make_pizza()

. To make

this module, we'll remove everything from the file *pizza.py* except the func-  
tion

make_pizza()

:

*pizza.py*

def make_pizza(size, \*toppings):  
"""Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""  
print(f"\\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")  
for topping in toppings:  
print(f"- {topping}")

Now we'll make a separate file called *making_pizzas.py* in the same

directory as *pizza.py* . This file imports the module we just created and then   
makes two calls to

make_pizza()

:

*making*

*_pizzas.py*

import pizza

1

pizza.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')

pizza.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

When Python reads this file, the line

import pizza

tells Python to open

the file *pizza.py* and copy all the functions from it into this program. You   
don't actually see code being copied between files because Python copies   
the code behind the scenes, just before the program runs. All you need   
to know is that any function defined in *pizza.py* will now be available in   
*making_pizzas.py*.

To call a function from an imported module, enter the name of the

module you imported,

pizza

, followed by the name of the function,

make

_pizza()

, separated by a dot

1

. This code produces the same output as the

original program that didn't import a module:

Making a 16-inch pizza with the following toppings:  
- pepperoni

Making a 12-inch pizza with the following toppings:  
- mushrooms  
- green peppers  
- extra cheese

This first approach to importing, in which you simply write

import

fol-

lowed by the name of the module, makes every function from the module  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress189.png)

Functions

**151**

available in your program. If you use this kind of

import

statement to import

an entire module named *module_name.py* , each function in the module is   
available through the following syntax:

*module_name*

.

*function_name*

()

***Importing Specific Functions***

You can also import a specific function from a module. Here's the general   
syntax for this approach:

from

*module_name*

import

*function_name*

You can import as many functions as you want from a module by sepa-

rating each function's name with a comma:

from

*module_name*

import

*function_0*

,

*function_1*

,

*function_2*

The *making_pizzas.py* example would look like this if we want to import

just the function we're going to use:

from pizza import make_pizza

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')  
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

With this syntax, you don't need to use the dot notation when you call a

function. Because we've explicitly imported the function

make_pizza()

in the

import

statement, we can call it by name when we use the function.

***Using as to Give a Function an Alias***

If the name of a function you're importing might conflict with an exist-  
ing name in your program, or if the function name is long, you can use a   
short, unique *alias* ---an alternate name similar to a nickname for the func-  
tion. You'll give the function this special nickname when you import the   
function.

Here we give the function

make_pizza()

an alias,

mp()

, by importing

make

_pizza as mp

. The

as

keyword renames a function using the alias you provide:

from pizza import make_pizza as mp

mp(16, 'pepperoni')  
mp(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

The

import

statement shown here renames the function

make_pizza()

to

mp()

in this program. Anytime we want to call

make_pizza()

we can simply

write

mp()

instead, and Python will run the code in

make_pizza()

while avoid-

ing any confusion with another

make_pizza()

function you might have writ-

ten in this program file.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress190.png)

**152**

Chapter 8

The general syntax for providing an alias is:

from

*module_name*

import

*function_name*

as

*fn*

***Using as to Give a Module an Alias***

You can also provide an alias for a module name. Giving a module a short   
alias, like

p

for

pizza

, allows you to call the module's functions more quickly.

Calling

p.make_pizza()

is more concise than calling

pizza.make_pizza()

:

import pizza as p

p.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')  
p.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

The module

pizza

is given the alias

p

in the

import

statement, but all of

the module's functions retain their original names. Calling the functions   
by writing

p.make_pizza()

is not only more concise than

pizza.make_pizza()

,

but it also redirects your attention from the module name and allows you   
to focus on the descriptive names of its functions. These function names,   
which clearly tell you what each function does, are more important to the   
readability of your code than using the full module name.

The general syntax for this approach is:

import

*module_name*

as

*mn*

***Importing All Functions in a Module***

You can tell Python to import every function in a module by using the aster-  
isk (

\*

) operator:

from pizza import \*

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')  
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

The asterisk in the

import

statement tells Python to copy every function

from the module

pizza

into this program file. Because every function is

imported, you can call each function by name without using the dot notation.   
However, it's best not to use this approach when you're working with larger   
modules that you didn't write: if the module has a function name that matches   
an existing name in your project, you can get unexpected results. Python may   
see several functions or variables with the same name, and instead of import-  
ing all the functions separately, it will overwrite the functions.

The best approach is to import the function or functions you want, or

import the entire module and use the dot notation. This leads to clear code   
that's easy to read and understand. I include this section so you'll recognize

import

statements like the following when you see them in other people's code:

from

*module_name*

import \*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress191.png)

Functions

**153**

**Styling Functions**

You need to keep a few details in mind when you're styling functions.   
Functions should have descriptive names, and these names should use   
lowercase letters and underscores. Descriptive names help you and others   
understand what your code is trying to do. Module names should use these   
conventions as well.

Every function should have a comment that explains concisely what

the function does. This comment should appear immediately after the   
function definition and use the docstring format. In a well-documented   
function, other programmers can use the function by reading only the   
description in the docstring. They should be able to trust that the code   
works as described, and as long as they know the name of the function, the   
arguments it needs, and the kind of value it returns, they should be able to   
use it in their programs.

If you specify a default value for a parameter, no spaces should be used

on either side of the equal sign:

def

*function_name*

(

*parameter_0*

,

*parameter_1*

='

*default value*

')

The same convention should be used for keyword arguments in func-

tion calls:

*function_name*

(

*value_0*

,

*parameter_1*

='

*value*

')

PE[P 8 (*https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)) recommends that you

limit lines of code to 79 characters so every line is visible in a reasonably   
sized editor window. If a set of parameters causes a function's definition to   
be longer than 79 characters, press ENTER after the opening parenthesis   
on the definition line. On the next line, press the TAB key twice to separate   
the list of arguments from the body of the function, which will only be   
indented one level.

Most editors automatically line up any additional lines of arguments to

match the indentation you have established on the first line:

def

*function_name*

(

*parameter_0*

,

*parameter_1*

,

*parameter_2*

,

*parameter_3*

,

*parameter_4*

,

*parameter_5*

):

*function body...*

If your program or module has more than one function, you can sepa-

rate each by two blank lines to make it easier to see where one function   
ends and the next one begins.

All

import

statements should be written at the beginning of a file. The

only exception is if you use comments at the beginning of your file to   
describe the overall program.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**8-15. Printing Models:**

Put the functions for the example

*printing_models.py*

in a

separate file called

*printing_functions.py*

. Write an import statement at the top

of

*printing_models.py*

, and modify the file to use the imported functions.

**8-16. Imports:**

Using a program you wrote that has one function in it, store that

function in a separate file. Import the function into your main program file, and   
call the function using each of these approaches:

import

*module_name*

from

*module_name*

import

*function_name*

from

*module_name*

import

*function_name*

as

*fn*

import

*module_name*

from

**8-17. Styling Functions:**

Choose any three programs you wrote for this chapter,

and make sure they follow the styling guidelines described in this section.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to write functions and to pass arguments   
so that your functions have access to the information they need to do their   
work. You learned how to use positional and keyword arguments, and also   
how to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. You saw functions that   
display output and functions that return values. You learned how to use   
functions with lists, dictionaries,

if

statements, and

while

loops. You also saw

how to store your functions in separate files called *modules* , so your program   
files will be simpler and easier to understand. Finally, you learned to style   
your functions so your programs will continue to be well-structured and as   
easy as possible for you and others to read.

One of your goals as a programmer should be to write simple code that

does what you want it to, and functions help you do this. They allow you to   
write blocks of code and leave them alone once you know they work. When   
you know a function does its job correctly, you can trust that it will continue   
to work and move on to your next coding task.

Functions allow you to write code once and then reuse that code as

many times as you want. When you need to run the code in a function, all   
you need to do is write a one-line call and the function does its job. When   
you need to modify a function's behavior, you only have to modify one   
block of code, and your change takes effect everywhere you've made a call   
to that function.

Using functions makes your programs easier to read, and good func-

tion names summarize what each part of a program does. Reading a series   
of function calls gives you a much quicker sense of what a program does   
than reading a long series of code blocks.

Functions

**155**

Functions also make your code easier to test and debug. When the bulk

of your program's work is done by a set of functions, each of which has a   
specific job, it's much easier to test and maintain the code you've written.   
You can write a separate program that calls each function and tests whether   
each function works in all the situations it may encounter. When you do   
this, you can be confident that your functions will work properly each time   
you call them.

I[n Chapter 9,](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#195) you'll learn to write classes. *Classes* combine functions and

data into one neat package that can be used in flexible and efficient ways.

**C L A S S E S**

*Object-oriented programming (OOP)* is one of

the most effective approaches to writing

software. In object-oriented programming,

you write *classes* that represent real-world things

and situations, and you create *objects* based on these   
classes. When you write a class, you define the general   
behavior that a whole category of objects can have.

When you create individual objects from the class, each object is auto-

matically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each   
object whatever unique traits you desire. You'll be amazed how well real-  
world situations can be modeled with object-oriented programming.

Making an object from a class is called *instantiation*, and you work with

*instances* of a class. In this chapter you'll write classes and create instances   
of those classes. You'll specify the kind of information that can be stored in   
instances, and you'll define actions that can be taken with these instances.   
You'll also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so   
similar classes can share common functionality, and you can do more with

Chapter 9

less code. You'll store your classes in modules and import classes written by   
other programmers into your own program files.

Learning about object-oriented programming will help you see the world

as a programmer does. It'll help you understand your code---not just what's   
happening line by line, but also the bigger concepts behind it. Knowing the   
logic behind classes will train you to think logically, so you can write pro-  
grams that effectively address almost any problem you encounter.

Classes also make life easier for you and the other programmers you'll

work with as you take on increasingly complex challenges. When you and   
other programmers write code based on the same kind of logic, you'll be   
able to understand each other's work. Your programs will make sense to the   
people you work with, allowing everyone to accomplish more.

**Creating and Using a Class**

You can model almost anything using classes. Let's start by writing a simple   
class,

Dog

, that represents a dog---not one dog in particular, but any dog. What

do we know about most pet dogs? Well, they all have a name and an age. We   
also know that most dogs sit and roll over. Those two pieces of information   
(name and age) and those two behaviors (sit and roll over) will go in our

Dog

class because they're common to most dogs. This class will tell Python how   
to make an object representing a dog. After our class is written, we'll use it to   
make individual instances, each of which represents one specific dog.

***Creating the Dog Class***

Each instance created from the

Dog

class will store a

name

and an

age

, and

we'll give each dog the ability to

sit()

and

roll_over()

:

*dog.py*

1

class Dog:

"""A simple attempt to model a dog."""

2

def __init__(self, name, age):

"""Initialize name and age attributes."""

3

self.name = name

self.age = age

4

def sit(self):

"""Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command."""  
print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")

def roll_over(self):  
"""Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""  
print(f"{self.name} rolled over!")

There's a lot to notice here, but don't worry. You'll see this structure

throughout this chapter and have lots of time to get used to it. We first   
define a class called

Dog

1

. By convention, capitalized names refer to classes

in Python. There are no parentheses in the class definition because we're   
creating this class from scratch. We then write a docstring describing what   
this class does.

Classes

***The __init__() Method***

A function that's part of a class is a *method* . Everything you learned about   
functions applies to methods as well; the only practical difference for now   
is the way we'll call methods. The

__init__()

method

2

is a special method

that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based   
on the

Dog

class. This method has two leading underscores and two trail-

ing underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python's default method   
names from conflicting with your method names. Make sure to use two   
underscores on each side of

__init__()

. If you use just one on each side, the

method won't be called automatically when you use your class, which can   
result in errors that are difficult to identify.

We define the

__init__()

method to have three parameters:

self

,

name

,

and

age

. The

self

parameter is required in the method definition, and

it must come first, before the other parameters. It must be included in   
the definition because when Python calls this method later (to create an   
instance of

Dog

), the method call will automatically pass the

self

argument.

Every method call associated with an instance automatically passes

self

,

which is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance   
access to the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an   
instance of

Dog

, Python will call the

__init__()

method from the

Dog

class.

We'll pass

Dog()

a name and an age as arguments;

self

is passed automati-

cally, so we don't need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an instance   
from the

Dog

class, we'll provide values for only the last two parameters,

name

and

age

.

The two variables defined in the body of the

__init__()

method each

have the prefix

self

3

. Any variable prefixed with

self

is available to every

method in the class, and we'll also be able to access these variables through   
any instance created from the class. The line

self.name = name

takes the

value associated with the parameter

name

and assigns it to the variable

name

,

which is then attached to the instance being created. The same process   
happens with

self.age = age

. Variables that are accessible through instances

like this are called *attributes*.

The

Dog

class has two other methods defined:

sit()

and

roll_over()

4

.

Because these methods don't need additional information to run, we just   
define them to have one parameter,

self

. The instances we create later

will have access to these methods. In other words, they'll be able to sit and   
roll over. For now,

sit()

and

roll_over()

don't do much. They simply print

a message saying the dog is sitting or rolling over. But the concept can be   
extended to realistic situations: if this class were part of a computer game,   
these methods would contain code to make an animated dog sit and roll   
over. If this class was written to control a robot, these methods would direct   
movements that cause a robotic dog to sit and roll over.

***Making an Instance from a Class***

Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance. The

Dog

class is a set of instructions that tells Python how to make individual

instances representing specific dogs.

Chapter 9

Let's make an instance representing a specific dog:

class Dog:  

*--snip--*

1

my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)

2

print(f"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.")

3

print(f"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.")

The

Dog

class we're using here is the one we just wrote in the previ-

ous example. Here, we tell Python to create a dog whose name is

'Willie'

and whose age is

6

1

. When Python reads this line, it calls the

__init__()

method in

Dog

with the arguments

'Willie'

and

6

. The

__init__()

method

creates an instance representing this particular dog and sets the

name

and

age

attributes using the values we provided. Python then returns an instance

representing this dog. We assign that instance to the variable

my_dog

. The

naming convention is helpful here; we can usually assume that a capitalized   
name like

Dog

refers to a class, and a lowercase name like

my_dog

refers to a

single instance created from a class.

**Accessing Attributes**

To access the attributes of an instance, you use dot notation. We access the   
value of

my_dog

's attribute

name

2

by writing:

my_dog.name

Dot notation is used often in Python. This syntax demonstrates how

Python finds an attribute's value. Here, Python looks at the instance

my_dog

and then finds the attribute

name

associated with

my_dog

. This is the same

attribute referred to as

self.name

in the class

Dog

. We use the same approach

to work with the attribute

age

3

.

The output is a summary of what we know about

my_dog

:

My dog's name is Willie.  
My dog is 6 years old.

**Calling Methods**

After we create an instance from the class

Dog

, we can use dot notation to

call any method defined in

Dog

. Let's make our dog sit and roll over:

class Dog:  

*--snip--*

my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)

my_dog.sit()  
my_dog.roll_over()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress199.png)

Classes

**161**

To call a method, give the name of the instance (in this case,

my_dog

)

and the method you want to call, separated by a dot. When Python reads

my_dog.sit()

, it looks for the method

sit()

in the class

Dog

and runs that

code. Python interprets the line

my_dog.roll_over()

in the same way.

Now Willie does what we tell him to:

Willie is now sitting.  
Willie rolled over!

This syntax is quite useful. When attributes and methods have been

given appropriately descriptive names like

name

,

age

,

sit()

, and

roll_over()

,

we can easily infer what a block of code, even one we've never seen before, is   
supposed to do.

**Creating Multiple Instances**

You can create as many instances from a class as you need. Let's create a   
second dog called

your_dog

:

class Dog:  

*--snip--*

my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)

your_dog = Dog('Lucy', 3)

print(f"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.")  
print(f"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.")  
my_dog.sit()

print(f"\\nYour dog's name is {your_dog.name}.")  
print(f"Your dog is {your_dog.age} years old.")  
your_dog.sit()

In this example we create a dog named Willie and a dog named Lucy.

Each dog is a separate instance with its own set of attributes, capable of the   
same set of actions:

My dog's name is Willie.  
My dog is 6 years old.  
Willie is now sitting.

Your dog's name is Lucy.  
Your dog is 3 years old.  
Lucy is now sitting.

Even if we used the same name and age for the second dog, Python

would still create a separate instance from the

Dog

class. You can make

as many instances from one class as you need, as long as you give each   
instance a unique variable name or it occupies a unique spot in a list or   
dictionary.

**162**

Chapter 9

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**9-1. Restaurant:**

Make a class called

Restaurant

. The

__init__()

method for

Restaurant

should store two attributes: a

restaurant_name

and a

cuisine_type

.

Make a method called

describe_restaurant()

that prints these two pieces of

information, and a method called

open_restaurant()

that prints a message indi-

cating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called

restaurant

from your class. Print the two attri-

butes individually, and then call both methods.

**9-2. Three Restaurants:**

Start with your class from Exercise 9-1. Create three

different instances from the class, and call

describe_restaurant()

for each

instance.

**9-3. Users:**

Make a class called

User

. Create two attributes called

first_name

and

last_name

, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored

in a user profile. Make a method called

describe_user()

that prints a summary

of the user's information. Make another method called

greet_user()

that prints

a personalized greeting to the user.

Create several instances representing different users, and call both meth-

ods for each user.

**Working with Classes and Instances**

You can use classes to represent many real-world situations. Once you write   
a class, you'll spend most of your time working with instances created from   
that class. One of the first tasks you'll want to do is modify the attributes   
associated with a particular instance. You can modify the attributes of an   
instance directly or write methods that update attributes in specific ways.

***The Car Class***

Let's write a new class representing a car. Our class will store information   
about the kind of car we're working with, and it will have a method that   
summarizes this information:

*car.py*

class Car:  
"""A simple attempt to represent a car."""

1

def __init__(self, make, model, year):

"""Initialize attributes to describe a car."""  
self.make = make  
self.model = model  
self.year = year

2

def get_descriptive_name(self):

"""Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""  
long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress201.png)

Classes

**163**

return long_name.title()

3

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2024)

print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

In the

Car

class, we define the

__init__()

method with the

self

parameter

first

1

, just like we did with the

Dog

class. We also give it three other param-

eters:

make

,

model

, and

year

. The

__init__()

method takes in these parameters

and assigns them to the attributes that will be associated with instances   
made from this class. When we make a new

Car

instance, we'll need to spec-

ify a make, model, and year for our instance.

We define a method called

get_descriptive_name()

2

that puts a car's

year

,

make

, and

model

into one string neatly describing the car. This will spare

us from having to print each attribute's value individually. To work with the   
attribute values in this method, we use

self.make

,

self.model

, and

self.year

.

Outside of the class, we make an instance from the

Car

class and assign it to

the variable

my_new_car

3

. Then we call

get_descriptive_name()

to show what

kind of car we have:

2024 Audi A4

To make the class more interesting, let's add an attribute that changes

over time. We'll add an attribute that stores the car's overall mileage.

***Setting a Default Value for an Attribute***

When an instance is created, attributes can be defined without being   
passed in as parameters. These attributes can be defined in the

__init__()

method, where they are assigned a default value.

Let's add an attribute called

odometer_reading

that always starts with a

value of 0. We'll also add a method

read_odometer()

that helps us read each

car's odometer:

class Car:

def __init__(self, make, model, year):  
"""Initialize attributes to describe a car."""  
self.make = make  
self.model = model  
self.year = year

1

self.odometer_reading = 0

def get_descriptive_name(self):

*--snip--*

2

def read_odometer(self):

"""Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""  
print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2024)  
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

my_new_car.read_odometer()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress202.png)

**164**

Chapter 9

This time, when Python calls the

__init__()

method to create a new

instance, it stores the make, model, and year values as attributes, like it   
did in the previous example. Then Python creates a new attribute called

odometer_reading

and sets its initial value to 0

1

. We also have a new method

called

read_odometer()

2

that makes it easy to read a car's mileage.

Our car starts with a mileage of 0:

2024 Audi A4  
This car has 0 miles on it.

Not many cars are sold with exactly 0 miles on the odometer, so we

need a way to change the value of this attribute.

***Modifying Attribute Values***

You can change an attribute's value in three ways: you can change the value   
directly through an instance, set the value through a method, or increment   
the value (add a certain amount to it) through a method. Let's look at each   
of these approaches.

**Modifying an Attribute's Value Directly**

The simplest way to modify the value of an attribute is to access the attri-  
bute directly through an instance. Here we set the odometer reading to 23   
directly:

class Car:  

*--snip--*

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2024)  
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

my_new_car.odometer_reading = 23

my_new_car.read_odometer()

We use dot notation to access the car's

odometer_reading

attribute, and

set its value directly. This line tells Python to take the instance

my_new_car

,

find the attribute

odometer_reading

associated with it, and set the value of

that attribute to 23:

2024 Audi A4  
This car has 23 miles on it.

Sometimes you'll want to access attributes directly like this, but other

times you'll want to write a method that updates the value for you.

**Modifying an Attribute's Value Through a Method**

It can be helpful to have methods that update certain attributes for you.   
Instead of accessing the attribute directly, you pass the new value to a   
method that handles the updating internally.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress203.png)

Classes

**165**

Here's an example showing a method called

update_odometer()

:

class Car:  

*--snip--*

def update_odometer(self, mileage):  
"""Set the odometer reading to the given value."""  
self.odometer_reading = mileage

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2024)  
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

1

my_new_car.update_odometer(23)

my_new_car.read_odometer()

The only modification to

Car

is the addition of

update_odometer()

. This

method takes in a mileage value and assigns it to

self.odometer_reading

.

Using the

my_new_car

instance, we call

update_odometer()

with

23

as an argu-

ment

1

. This sets the odometer reading to 23, and

read_odometer()

prints

the reading:

2024 Audi A4  
This car has 23 miles on it.

We can extend the method

update_odometer()

to do additional work every

time the odometer reading is modified. Let's add a little logic to make sure   
no one tries to roll back the odometer reading:

class Car:  

*--snip--*

def update_odometer(self, mileage):

"""  
Set the odometer reading to the given value.  
Reject the change if it attempts to roll the odometer back.  
"""

1

if mileage \>= self.odometer_reading:

self.odometer_reading = mileage

else:

2

print("You can't roll back an odometer!")

Now

update_odometer()

checks that the new reading makes sense before

modifying the attribute. If the value provided for

mileage

is greater than

or equal to the existing mileage,

self.odometer_reading

, you can update

the odometer reading to the new mileage

1

. If the new mileage is less

than the existing mileage, you'll get a warning that you can't roll back an   
odometer

2

.

**Incrementing an Attribute's Value Through a Method**

Sometimes you'll want to increment an attribute's value by a certain amount,   
rather than set an entirely new value. Say we buy a used car and put 100 miles  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress204.png)

**166**

Chapter 9

on it between the time we buy it and the time we register it. Here's a   
method that allows us to pass this incremental amount and add that value   
to the odometer reading:

class Car:  

*--snip--*

def update_odometer(self, mileage):  

*--snip--*

def increment_odometer(self, miles):  
"""Add the given amount to the odometer reading."""  
self.odometer_reading += miles

1

my_used_car = Car('subaru', 'outback', 2019)

print(my_used_car.get_descriptive_name())

2

my_used_car.update_odometer(23_500)

my_used_car.read_odometer()

my_used_car.increment_odometer(100)  
my_used_car.read_odometer()

The new method

increment_odometer()

takes in a number of miles, and adds

this value to

self.odometer_reading

. First, we create a used car,

my_used_car

1

.

We set its odometer to 23,500 by calling

update_odometer()

and passing it

23_500

2

. Finally, we call

increment_odometer()

and pass it

100

to add the

100 miles that we drove between buying the car and registering it:

2019 Subaru Outback  
This car has 23500 miles on it.  
This car has 23600 miles on it.

You can modify this method to reject negative increments so no one

uses this function to roll back an odometer as well.

**N O T E**

*You can use methods like this to control how users of your program update values*

*such as an odometer reading, but anyone with access to the program can set the odom-
eter reading to any value by accessing the attribute directly. Effective security takes
extreme attention to detail in addition to basic checks like those shown here.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**9-4. Number Served:**

Start with your program from Exercise 9-[1 (page 162](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#200)).

Add an attribute called

number_served

with a default value of 0. Create an

instance called

restaurant

from this class. Print the number of customers the

restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress205.png)

Classes

**167**

Add a method called

set_number_served()

that lets you set the number of

customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print   
the value again.

Add a method called

increment_number_served()

that lets you increment

the number of customers who've been served. Call this method with any number   
you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of   
business.

**9-5. Login Attempts:**

Add an attribute called

login_attempts

to your

User

class

from Exercise 9-3 [(page 162](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#200)). Write a method called

increment_login_attempts()

that increments the value of

login_attempts

by 1. Write another method called

reset_login_attempts()

that resets the value of

login_attempts

to 0.

Make an instance of the

User

class and call

increment_login_attempts()

several times. Print the value of

login_attempts

to make sure it was incremented

properly, and then call

reset_login_attempts()

. Print

login_attempts

again to

make sure it was reset to 0.

**Inheritance**

You don't always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class   
you're writing is a specialized version of another class you wrote, you can   
use *inheritance* . When one class *inherits* from another, it takes on the attri-  
butes and methods of the first class. The original class is called the *parent
class* , and the new class is the *child class* . The child class can inherit any   
or all of the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it's also free to   
define new attributes and methods of its own.

***The __init__() Method for a Child Class***

When you're writing a new class based on an existing class, you'll often   
want to call the

__init__()

method from the parent class. This will initialize

any attributes that were defined in the parent

__init__()

method and make

them available in the child class.

As an example, let's model an electric car. An electric car is just a spe-

cific kind of car, so we can base our new

ElectricCar

class on the

Car

class

we wrote earlier. Then we'll only have to write code for the attributes and   
behaviors specific to electric cars.

Let's start by making a simple version of the

ElectricCar

class, which

does everything the

Car

class does:

*electric_car.py*

1

class Car:  
"""A simple attempt to represent a car."""

def __init__(self, make, model, year):  
"""Initialize attributes to describe a car.""  
self.make = make  
self.model = model  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress206.png)

**168**

Chapter 9

self.year = year  
self.odometer_reading = 0

def get_descriptive_name(self):  
"""Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""  
long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"  
return long_name.title()

def read_odometer(self):  
"""Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""  
print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")

def update_odometer(self, mileage):  
"""Set the odometer reading to the given value."""  
if mileage \>= self.odometer_reading:  
self.odometer_reading = mileage  
else:  
print("You can't roll back an odometer!")

def increment_odometer(self, miles):  
"""Add the given amount to the odometer reading."""  
self.odometer_reading += miles

2

class ElectricCar(Car):

"""Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

3

def __init__(self, make, model, year):

"""Initialize attributes of the parent class."""

4

super().__init__(make, model, year)

5

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)

print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())

We start with

Car

1

. When you create a child class, the parent class

must be part of the current file and must appear before the child class in   
the file. We then define the child class,

ElectricCar

2

. The name of the par-

ent class must be included in parentheses in the definition of a child class.   
The

__init__()

method takes in the information required to make a

Car

instance

3

.

The

super()

function

4

is a special function that allows you to call a

method from the parent class. This line tells Python to call the

__init__()

method from

Car

, which gives an

ElectricCar

instance all the attributes

defined in that method. The name *super* comes from a convention of calling   
the parent class a *superclass* and the child class a *subclass*.

We test whether inheritance is working properly by trying to create

an electric car with the same kind of information we'd provide when   
making a regular car. We make an instance of the

ElectricCar

class and

assign it to

my_leaf

5

. This line calls the

__init__()

method defined in

ElectricCar

, which in turn tells Python to call the

__init__()

method

defined in the parent class

Car

. We provide the arguments

'nissan'

,

'leaf'

, and

2024

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress207.png)

Classes

**169**

Aside from

__init__()

, there are no attributes or methods yet that are

particular to an electric car. At this point we're just making sure the electric   
car has the appropriate

Car

behaviors:

2024 Nissan Leaf

The

ElectricCar

instance works just like an instance of

Car

, so now we

can begin defining attributes and methods specific to electric cars.

***Defining Attributes and Methods for the Child Class***

Once you have a child class that inherits from a parent class, you can add   
any new attributes and methods necessary to differentiate the child class   
from the parent class.

Let's add an attribute that's specific to electric cars (a battery, for example)

and a method to report on this attribute. We'll store the battery size and   
write a method that prints a description of the battery:

class Car:  

*--snip--*

class ElectricCar(Car):  
"""Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

def __init__(self, make, model, year):  

"""

Initialize attributes of the parent class.  
Then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.  
"""

super().__init__(make, model, year)

1

self.battery_size = 40

2

def describe_battery(self):

"""Print a statement describing the battery size."""  
print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)  
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())

my_leaf.describe_battery()

We add a new attribute

self.battery_size

and set its initial value to

40

1

. This attribute will be associated with all instances created from the

ElectricCar

class but won't be associated with any instances of

Car

. We also

add a method called

describe_battery()

that prints information about the

battery

2

. When we call this method, we get a description that is clearly

specific to an electric car:

2024 Nissan Leaf  
This car has a 40-kWh battery.

There's no limit to how much you can specialize the

ElectricCar

class.

You can add as many attributes and methods as you need to model an  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress208.png)

**170**

Chapter 9

electric car to whatever degree of accuracy you need. An attribute or   
method that could belong to any car, rather than one that's specific to an   
electric car, should be added to the

Car

class instead of the

ElectricCar

class.

Then anyone who uses the

Car

class will have that functionality available as

well, and the

ElectricCar

class will only contain code for the information

and behavior specific to electric vehicles.

***Overriding Methods from the Parent Class***

You can override any method from the parent class that doesn't fit what   
you're trying to model with the child class. To do this, you define a method in   
the child class with the same name as the method you want to override in   
the parent class. Python will disregard the parent class method and only pay   
attention to the method you define in the child class.

Say the class

Car

had a method called

fill_gas_tank()

. This method is

meaningless for an all-electric vehicle, so you might want to override this   
method. Here's one way to do that:

class ElectricCar(Car):  

*--snip--*

def fill_gas_tank(self):  
"""Electric cars don't have gas tanks."""  
print("This car doesn't have a gas tank!")

Now if someone tries to call

fill_gas_tank()

with an electric car, Python

will ignore the method

fill_gas_tank()

in

Car

and run this code instead.

When you use inheritance, you can make your child classes retain what you   
need and override anything you don't need from the parent class.

***Instances as Attributes***

When modeling something from the real world in code, you may find that   
you're adding more and more detail to a class. You'll find that you have a   
growing list of attributes and methods and that your files are becoming   
lengthy. In these situations, you might recognize that part of one class can   
be written as a separate class. You can break your large class into smaller   
classes that work together; this approach is called *composition*.

For example, if we continue adding detail to the

ElectricCar

class, we

might notice that we're adding many attributes and methods specific to   
the car's battery. When we see this happening, we can stop and move those   
attributes and methods to a separate class called

Battery

. Then we can use a

Battery

instance as an attribute in the

ElectricCar

class:

class Car:  

*--snip--*

class Battery:  
"""A simple attempt to model a battery for an electric car."""

1

def __init__(self, battery_size=40):  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress209.png)

Classes

**171**

"""Initialize the battery's attributes."""  
self.battery_size = battery_size

2

def describe_battery(self):

"""Print a statement describing the battery size."""  
print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

class ElectricCar(Car):  
"""Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

def __init__(self, make, model, year):  
"""  
Initialize attributes of the parent class.  
Then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.  
"""  
super().__init__(make, model, year)

3

self.battery = Battery()

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)  
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())

my_leaf.battery.describe_battery()

We define a new class called

Battery

that doesn't inherit from any other

class. The

__init__()

method

1

has one parameter,

battery_size

, in addition

to

self

. This is an optional parameter that sets the battery's size to 40 if no

value is provided. The method

describe_battery()

has been moved to this

class as well

2

.

In the

ElectricCar

class, we now add an attribute called

self.battery

3

.

This line tells Python to create a new instance of

Battery

(with a default size

of 40, because we're not specifying a value) and assign that instance to the   
attribute

self.battery

. This will happen every time the

__init__()

method

is called; any

ElectricCar

instance will now have a

Battery

instance created

automatically.

We create an electric car and assign it to the variable

my_leaf

. When

we want to describe the battery, we need to work through the car's

battery

attribute:

my_leaf.battery.describe_battery()

This line tells Python to look at the instance

my_leaf

, find its

battery

attribute, and call the method

describe_battery()

that's associated with the

Battery

instance assigned to the attribute.

The output is identical to what we saw previously:

2024 Nissan Leaf  
This car has a 40-kWh battery.

This looks like a lot of extra work, but now we can describe the battery

in as much detail as we want without cluttering the

ElectricCar

class. Let's  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress210.png)

**172**

Chapter 9

add another method to

Battery

that reports the range of the car based on

the battery size:

class Car:  

*--snip--*

class Battery:  

*--snip--*

def get_range(self):  
"""Print a statement about the range this battery provides."""  
if self.battery_size == 40:  
range = 150  
elif self.battery_size == 65:  
range = 225

print(f"This car can go about {range} miles on a full charge.")

class ElectricCar(Car):  

*--snip--*

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)  
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())  
my_leaf.battery.describe_battery()

1

my_leaf.battery.get_range()

The new method

get_range()

performs some simple analysis. If the bat-

tery's capacity is 40 kWh,

get_range()

sets the range to 150 miles, and if the

capacity is 65 kWh, it sets the range to 225 miles. It then reports this value.   
When we want to use this method, we again have to call it through the car's

battery

attribute

1

.

The output tells us the range of the car based on its battery size:

2024 Nissan Leaf  
This car has a 40-kWh battery.  
This car can go about 150 miles on a full charge.

***Modeling Real-World Objects***

As you begin to model more complicated things like electric cars, you'll   
wrestle with interesting questions. Is the range of an electric car a property   
of the battery or of the car? If we're only describing one car, it's probably   
fine to maintain the association of the method

get_range()

with the

Battery

class. But if we're describing a manufacturer's entire line of cars, we proba-  
bly want to move

get_range()

to the

ElectricCar

class. The

get_range()

method

would still check the battery size before determining the range, but it would   
report a range specific to the kind of car it's associated with. Alternatively,   
we could maintain the association of the

get_range()

method with the bat-

tery but pass it a parameter such as

car_model

. The

get_range()

method would

then report a range based on the battery size and car model.

This brings you to an interesting point in your growth as a program-

mer. When you wrestle with questions like these, you're thinking at a higher  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress211.png)

Classes

**173**

logical level rather than a syntax-focused level. You're thinking not about   
Python, but about how to represent the real world in code. When you reach   
this point, you'll realize there are often no right or wrong approaches to   
modeling real-world situations. Some approaches are more efficient than   
others, but it takes practice to find the most efficient representations. If   
your code is working as you want it to, you're doing well! Don't be discour-  
aged if you find you're ripping apart your classes and rewriting them several   
times using different approaches. In the quest to write accurate, efficient   
code, everyone goes through this process.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**9-6. Ice Cream Stand:**

An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write

a class called

IceCreamStand

that inherits from the

Restaurant

class you wrote in

Exercise 9-1[(page 162) o](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#200)r Exercise 9-4 ([page 166](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#204)). Either version of the class   
will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called

flavors

that

stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays these flavors.   
Create an instance of

IceCreamStand

, and call this method.

**9-7. Admin:**

An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called

Admin

that inherits from the

User

class you wrote in Exercise 9-[3 (page 162](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#200))

or Exercise 9-5 ([page 167](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#205)). Add an attribute,

privileges

, that stores a list of

strings like

"can add post"

,

"can delete post"

,

"can ban user"

, and so on.

Write a method called

show_privileges()

that lists the administrator's set of

privileges. Create an instance of

Admin

, and call your method.

**9-8. Privileges:**

Write a separate

Privileges

class. The class should have one

attribute,

privileges

, that stores a list of strings as described in Exercise 9-7.

Move the

show_privileges()

method to this class. Make a

Privileges

instance

as an attribute in the

Admin

class. Create a new instance of

Admin

and use your

method to show its privileges.

**9-9. Battery Upgrade:**

Use the final version of

*electric_car.py*

from this section.

Add a method to the

Battery

class called

upgrade_battery()

. This method

should check the battery size and set the capacity to 65 if it isn't already. Make   
an electric car with a default battery size, call

get_range()

once, and then

call

get_range()

a second time after upgrading the battery. You should see an

increase in the car's range.

**Importing Classes**

As you add more functionality to your classes, your files can get long, even   
when you use inheritance and composition properly. In keeping with the   
overall philosophy of Python, you'll want to keep your files as uncluttered as   
possible. To help, Python lets you store classes in modules and then import   
the classes you need into your main program.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress212.png)

**174**

Chapter 9

***Importing a Single Class***

Let's create a module containing just the

Car

class. This brings up a subtle

naming issue: we already have a file named *car.py* in this chapter, but this   
module should be named *car.py* because it contains code representing a car.   
We'll resolve this naming issue by storing the

Car

class in a module named

*car.py* , replacing the *car.py* file we were previously using. From now on, any   
program that uses this module will need a more specific filename, such as   
*my_car.py* . Here's *car.py* with just the code from the class

Car

:

*car.py*

1

"""A class that can be used to represent a car."""

class Car:  
"""A simple attempt to represent a car."""

def __init__(self, make, model, year):  
"""Initialize attributes to describe a car."""  
self.make = make  
self.model = model  
self.year = year  
self.odometer_reading = 0

def get_descriptive_name(self):  
"""Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""  
long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"  
return long_name.title()

def read_odometer(self):  
"""Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""  
print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")

def update_odometer(self, mileage):  
"""  
Set the odometer reading to the given value.  
Reject the change if it attempts to roll the odometer back.  
"""  
if mileage \>= self.odometer_reading:  
self.odometer_reading = mileage  
else:  
print("You can't roll back an odometer!")

def increment_odometer(self, miles):  
"""Add the given amount to the odometer reading."""  
self.odometer_reading += miles

We include a module-level docstring that briefly describes the contents

of this module

1

. You should write a docstring for each module you create.

Now we make a separate file called *my_car.py*. This file will import the

Car

class and then create an instance from that class:

*my_car.py*

1

from car import Car

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2024)  
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress213.png)

Classes

**175**

my_new_car.odometer_reading = 23  
my_new_car.read_odometer()

The

import

statement

1

tells Python to open the

car

module and import

the class

Car

. Now we can use the

Car

class as if it were defined in this file.

The output is the same as we saw earlier:

2024 Audi A4  
This car has 23 miles on it.

Importing classes is an effective way to program. Picture how long

this program file would be if the entire

Car

class were included. When you

instead move the class to a module and import the module, you still get all   
the same functionality, but you keep your main program file clean and easy   
to read. You also store most of the logic in separate files; once your classes   
work as you want them to, you can leave those files alone and focus on the   
higher-level logic of your main program.

***Storing Multiple Classes in a Module***

You can store as many classes as you need in a single module, although   
each class in a module should be related somehow. The classes

Battery

and

ElectricCar

both help represent cars, so let's add them to the module *car.py*.

*car.py*

"""A set of classes used to represent gas and electric cars."""

class Car:  

*--snip--*

class Battery:  
"""A simple attempt to model a battery for an electric car."""

def __init__(self, battery_size=40):  
"""Initialize the battery's attributes."""  
self.battery_size = battery_size

def describe_battery(self):  
"""Print a statement describing the battery size."""  
print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

def get_range(self):  
"""Print a statement about the range this battery provides."""  
if self.battery_size == 40:  
range = 150  
elif self.battery_size == 65:  
range = 225

print(f"This car can go about {range} miles on a full charge.")

class ElectricCar(Car):  
"""Models aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

def __init__(self, make, model, year):  
"""  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress214.png)

**176**

Chapter 9

Initialize attributes of the parent class.  
Then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.  
"""  
super().__init__(make, model, year)  
self.battery = Battery()

Now we can make a new file called *my_electric_car.py*, import the

ElectricCar

class, and make an electric car:

*my_electric*

*_car.py*

from car import ElectricCar

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)  
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())  
my_leaf.battery.describe_battery()  
my_leaf.battery.get_range()

This has the same output we saw earlier, even though most of the logic

is hidden away in a module:

2024 Nissan Leaf  
This car has a 40-kWh battery.  
This car can go about 150 miles on a full charge.

***Importing Multiple Classes from a Module***

You can import as many classes as you need into a program file. If we   
want to make a regular car and an electric car in the same file, we need to   
import both classes,

Car

and

ElectricCar

:

*my_cars.py*

1

from car import Car, ElectricCar

2

my_mustang = Car('ford', 'mustang', 2024)

print(my_mustang.get_descriptive_name())

3

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)

print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())

You import multiple classes from a module by separating each class

with a comma

1

. Once you've imported the necessary classes, you're free to

make as many instances of each class as you need.

In this example we make a gas-powered Ford Mustang

2

and then an

electric Nissan Leaf

3

:

2024 Ford Mustang  
2024 Nissan Leaf

***Importing an Entire Module***

You can also import an entire module and then access the classes you need   
using dot notation. This approach is simple and results in code that is easy   
to read. Because every call that creates an instance of a class includes the   
module name, you won't have naming conflicts with any names used in the   
current file.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress215.png)

Classes

**177**

Here's what it looks like to import the entire

car

module and then

create a regular car and an electric car:

*my_cars.py*

1

import car

2

my_mustang = car.Car('ford', 'mustang', 2024)

print(my_mustang.get_descriptive_name())

3

my_leaf = car.ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)

print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())

First we import the entire

car

module

1

. We then access the classes

we need through the

*module_name*

.

*ClassName*

syntax. We again create a Ford

Mustang

2

, and a Nissan Leaf

3

.

***Importing All Classes from a Module***

You can import every class from a module using the following syntax:

from

*module_name*

import \*

This method is not recommended for two reasons. First, it's helpful to be

able to read the

import

statements at the top of a file and get a clear sense of

which classes a program uses. With this approach it's unclear which classes   
you're using from the module. This approach can also lead to confusion   
with names in the file. If you accidentally import a class with the same name   
as something else in your program file, you can create errors that are hard   
to diagnose. I show this here because even though it's not a recommended   
approach, you're likely to see it in other people's code at some point.

If you need to import many classes from a module, you're better off

importing the entire module and using the

*module_name.ClassName*

syntax.

You won't see all the classes used at the top of the file, but you'll see clearly   
where the module is used in the program. You'll also avoid the potential   
naming conflicts that can arise when you import every class in a module.

***Importing a Module into a Module***

Sometimes you'll want to spread out your classes over several modules to   
keep any one file from growing too large and avoid storing unrelated classes   
in the same module. When you store your classes in several modules, you   
may find that a class in one module depends on a class in another module.   
When this happens, you can import the required class into the first module.

For example, let's store the

Car

class in one module and the

ElectricCar

and

Battery

classes in a separate module. We'll make a new module called

*electric_car.py* ---replacing the *electric_car.py* file we created earlier---and copy   
just the

Battery

and

ElectricCar

classes into this file:

*electric_car.py*

"""A set of classes that can be used to represent electric cars."""

from car import Car  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress216.png)

**178**

Chapter 9

class Battery:  

*--snip--*

class ElectricCar(Car):  

*--snip--*

The class

ElectricCar

needs access to its parent class

Car

, so we import

Car

directly into the module. If we forget this line, Python will raise an error

when we try to import the

electric_car

module. We also need to update the

Car

module so it contains only the

Car

class:

*car.py*

"""A class that can be used to represent a car."""

class Car:  

*--snip--*

Now we can import from each module separately and create whatever

kind of car we need:

*my_cars.py*

from car import Car  
from electric_car import ElectricCar

my_mustang = Car('ford', 'mustang', 2024)  
print(my_mustang.get_descriptive_name())

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)  
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())

We import

Car

from its module, and

ElectricCar

from its module. We

then create one regular car and one electric car. Both cars are created   
correctly:

2024 Ford Mustang  
2024 Nissan Leaf

***Using Aliases***

As you saw in [Chapter 8, a](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#167)liases can be quite helpful when using modules   
to organize your projects' code. You can use aliases when importing classes   
as well.

As an example, consider a program where you want to make a bunch

of electric cars. It might get tedious to type (and read)

ElectricCar

over and

over again. You can give

ElectricCar

an alias in the import statement:

from electric_car import ElectricCar as EC

Now you can use this alias whenever you want to make an electric car:

my_leaf = EC('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress217.png)

Classes

**179**

You can also give a module an alias. Here's how to import the entire

electric_car

module using an alias:

import electric_car as ec

Now you can use this module alias with the full class name:

my_leaf = ec.ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)

***Finding Your Own Workflow***

As you can see, Python gives you many options for how to structure code   
in a large project. It's important to know all these possibilities so you can   
determine the best ways to organize your projects as well as understand   
other people's projects.

When you're starting out, keep your code structure simple. Try doing

everything in one file and moving your classes to separate modules once every-  
thing is working. If you like how modules and files interact, try storing your   
classes in modules when you start a project. Find an approach that lets you   
write code that works, and go from there.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**9-10. Imported Restaurant:**

Using your latest

Restaurant

class, store it in a mod-

ule. Make a separate file that imports

Restaurant

. Make a

Restaurant

instance,

and call one of

Restaurant

's methods to show that the

import

statement is work-

ing properly.

**9-11. Imported Admin:**

Start with your work from Exercise 9-8 ([page 173)](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#211). Store

the classes

User

,

Privileges

, and

Admin

in one module. Create a separate file,

make an

Admin

instance, and call

show_privileges()

to show that everything is

working correctly.

**9-12. Multiple Modules:**

Store the

User

class in one module, and store the

Privileges

and

Admin

classes in a separate module. In a separate file, create

an

Admin

instance and call

show_privileges()

to show that everything is still

working correctly.

**The Python Standard Library**

The *Python standard library* is a set of modules included with every Python   
installation. Now that you have a basic understanding of how functions and   
classes work, you can start to use modules like these that other programmers   
have written. You can use any function or class in the standard library by   
including a simple

import

statement at the top of your file. Let's look at one

module,

random

, which can be useful in modeling many real-world situations.

One interesting function from the random module is

randint()

. This

function takes two integer arguments and returns a randomly selected inte-  
ger between (and including) those numbers.

Here's how to generate a random number between 1 and 6:

\>\>\>

**from random import randint**

\>\>\>

**randint(1, 6)**

3

Another useful function is

choice()

. This function takes in a list or tuple

and returns a randomly chosen element:

\>\>\>

**from random import choice**

\>\>\>

**players = \['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'\]**

\>\>\>

**first_up = choice(players)**

\>\>\>

**first_up**

'florence'

The

random

module shouldn't be used when building security-related

applications, but it works well for many fun and interesting projects.

**N O T E**

*You can also download modules from external sources. You'll see a number of these*

*examples in Part II, where we'll need external modules to complete each project.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**9-13. Dice:**

Make a class

Die

with one attribute called

sides

, which has a

default value of 6. Write a method called

roll_die()

that prints a random num-

ber between 1 and the number of sides the die has. Make a 6-sided die and   
roll it 10 times.

Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die. Roll each die 10 times.

**9-14. Lottery:**

Make a list or tuple containing a series of 10 numbers and 5 letters.

Randomly select 4 numbers or letters from the list and print a message saying that   
any ticket matching these 4 numbers or letters wins a prize.

**9-15. Lottery Analysis:**

You can use a loop to see how hard it might be to win

the kind of lottery you just modeled. Make a list or tuple called

my_ticket

. Write

a loop that keeps pulling numbers until your ticket wins. Print a message report-  
ing how many times the loop had to run to give you a winning ticket.

**9-16. Python Module of the Week:**

One excellent resource for exploring the

Python standard library is a site called

*Python Module of the Week*

. Go to

[*https://pymotw.com*](https://pymotw.com)

[a](https://pymotw.com)nd look at the table of contents. Find a module that looks

interesting to you and read about it, perhaps starting with the

random

module.

Classes

**181**

**Styling Classes**

A few styling issues related to classes are worth clarifying, especially as your   
programs become more complicated.

Class names should be written in *CamelCase*. To do this, capitalize the

first letter of each word in the name, and don't use underscores. Instance   
and module names should be written in lowercase, with underscores   
between words.

Every class should have a docstring immediately following the class defi-

nition. The docstring should be a brief description of what the class does,   
and you should follow the same formatting conventions you used for writing   
docstrings in functions. Each module should also have a docstring describ-  
ing what the classes in a module can be used for.

You can use blank lines to organize code, but don't use them excessively.

Within a class you can use one blank line between methods, and within a   
module you can use two blank lines to separate classes.

If you need to import a module from the standard library and a module

that you wrote, place the import statement for the standard library module   
first. Then add a blank line and the import statement for the module you   
wrote. In programs with multiple import statements, this convention makes it   
easier to see where the different modules used in the program come from.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to write your own classes. You learned   
how to store information in a class using attributes and how to write meth-  
ods that give your classes the behavior they need. You learned to write

__init__()

methods that create instances from your classes with exactly the

attributes you want. You saw how to modify the attributes of an instance   
directly and through methods. You learned that inheritance can simplify   
the creation of classes that are related to each other, and you learned to   
use instances of one class as attributes in another class to keep each class   
simple.

You saw how storing classes in modules and importing classes you need

into the files where they'll be used can keep your projects organized. You   
started learning about the Python standard library, and you saw an example   
based on the

random

module. Finally, you learned to style your classes using

Python conventions.

I[n Chapter 10, y](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#221)ou'll learn to work with files so you can save the work

you've done in a program and the work you've allowed users to do. You'll   
also learn about *exceptions* , a special Python class designed to help you   
respond to errors when they arise.

Now that you've mastered the basic skills

you need to write organized programs that

are easy to use, it's time to think about making

your programs even more relevant and usable. In

this chapter, you'll learn to work with files so your pro-  
grams can quickly analyze lots of data.

You'll learn to handle errors so your programs don't crash when they

encounter unexpected situations. You'll learn about *exceptions* , which are   
special objects Python creates to manage errors that arise while a program   
is running. You'll also learn about the

json

module, which allows you to save

user data so it isn't lost when your program stops running.

Learning to work with files and save data will make your programs easier

for people to use. Users will be able to choose what data to enter and when   
to enter it. People will be able to run your program, do some work, and then   
close the program and pick up where they left off. Learning to handle excep-  
tions will help you deal with situations in which files don't exist and deal with   
other problems that can cause your programs to crash. This will make your   
programs more robust when they encounter bad data, whether it comes from

the skills you'll learn in this chapter, you'll make your programs more appli-  
cable, usable, and stable.

**Reading from a File**

An incredible amount of data is available in text files. Text files can contain   
weather data, traffic data, socioeconomic data, literary works, and more.   
Reading from a file is particularly useful in data analysis applications, but   
it's also applicable to any situation in which you want to analyze or modify   
information stored in a file. For example, you can write a program that   
reads in the contents of a text file and rewrites the file with formatting that   
allows a browser to display it.

When you want to work with the information in a text file, the first step

is to read the file into memory. You can then work through all of the file's   
contents at once or work through the contents line by line.

***Reading the Contents of a File***

To begin, we need a file with a few lines of text in it. Let's start with a file   
that contains *pi* to 30 decimal places, with 10 decimal places per line:

*pi_digits.txt*

3.1415926535  
8979323846  
2643383279

To try the following examples yourself, you can enter these lines in an

editor and save the file as *pi_digits.txt* , or you can download the file from   
the book's resources throug[h *https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e*](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e). Save the file   
in the same directory where you'll store this chapter's programs.

Here's a program that opens this file, reads it, and prints the contents

of the file to the screen:

*file_reader.py*

from pathlib import Path

1

path = Path('pi_digits.txt')

2

contents = path.read_text()

print(contents)

To work with the contents of a file, we need to tell Python the path to

the file. A *path* is the exact location of a file or folder on a system. Python   
provides a module called

pathlib

that makes it easier to work with files and

directories, no matter which operating system you or your program's users   
are working with. A module that provides specific functionality like this is   
often called a *library*, hence the name

pathlib

.

We start by importing the

Path

class from

pathlib

. There's a lot you can

do with a

Path

object that points to a file. For example, you can check that

the file exists before working with it, read the file's contents, or write new   
data to the file. Here, we build a

Path

object representing the file *pi_digits.txt*,

which we assign to the variable

path

1

. Since this file is saved in the same  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress223.png)

Files and Exceptions

**185**

directory as the *.py* file we're writing, the filename is all that

Path

needs to

access the file.

**N O T E**

*VS*

*Code looks for files in the folder that was most recently opened. If you're using VS*

*Code, start by opening the folder where you're storing this chapter's programs. For
example, if you're saving your program files in a folder called* chapter_10*, press
CTRL-O (*

â

*-O on macOS), and open that folder.*

Once we have a

Path

object representing *pi_digits.txt*, we use the

read_text()

method to read the entire contents of the file

2

. The contents of the file are

returned as a single string, which we assign to the variable

contents

. When we

print the value of

contents

, we see the entire contents of the text file:

3.1415926535  
8979323846  
2643383279

The only difference between this output and the original file is the

extra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because

read_text()

returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this

empty string shows up as a blank line.

We can remove the extra blank line by using

rstrip()

on the

contents

string:

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('pi_digits.txt')  
contents = path.read_text()

contents = contents.rstrip()

print(contents)

Recall from [Chapter 2 t](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#53)hat Python's

rstrip()

method removes, or strips,

any whitespace characters from the right side of a string. Now the output   
matches the contents of the original file exactly:

3.1415926535  
8979323846  
2643383279

We can strip the trailing newline character when we read the con-

tents of the file, by applying the

rstrip()

method immediately after calling

read_text()

:

contents = path.read_text().rstrip()

This line tells Python to call the

read_text()

method on the file we're

working with. Then it applies the

rstrip()

method to the string that

read

_text()

returns. The cleaned-up string is then assigned to the variable

contents

. This approach is called *method chaining*, and you'll see it used often

in programming.

Chapter 10

***Relative and Absolute File Paths***

When you pass a simple filename like *pi_digits.txt* to

Path

, Python looks in

the directory where the file that's currently being executed (that is, your *.py*   
program file) is stored.

Sometimes, depending on how you organize your work, the file you want

to open won't be in the same directory as your program file. For example,   
you might store your program files in a folder called *python_work* ; inside   
*python_work* , you might have another folder called *text_files* to distinguish   
your program files from the text files they're manipulating. Even though   
*text_files* is in *python_work*, just passing

Path

the name of a file in *text_files*

won't work, because Python will only look in *python_work* and stop there;   
it won't go on and look in *text_files.* To get Python to open files from a   
directory other than the one where your program file is stored, you need   
to provide the correct path.

There are two main ways to specify paths in programming. A *relative*

*file path* tells Python to look for a given location relative to the directory   
where the currently running program file is stored. Since *text_files* is inside   
*python_work* , we need to build a path that starts with the directory *text_files* ,   
and ends with the filename. Here's how to build this path:

path = Path('text_files/

*filename*

.txt')

You can also tell Python exactly where the file is on your computer,

regardless of where the program that's being executed is stored. This is   
called an *absolute file path* . You can use an absolute path if a relative path   
doesn't work. For instance, if you've put *text_files* in some folder other than   
*python_work*, then just passing

Path

the path

'text_files/

*filename*

.txt'

won't

work because Python will only look for that location inside *python_work* .   
You'll need to write out an absolute path to clarify where you want Python   
to look.

Absolute paths are usually longer than relative paths, because they start

at your system's root folder:

path = Path('/home/eric/data_files/text_files/

*filename*

.txt')

Using absolute paths, you can read files from any location on your sys-

tem. For now it's easiest to store files in the same directory as your program   
files, or in a folder such as *text_files* within the directory that stores your pro-  
gram files.

**N O T E**

*Windows systems use a backslash (*

*\\*

*) instead of a forward slash (*

*/*

*) when displaying*

*file paths, but you should use forward slashes in your code, even on Windows. The*

*pathlib*

*library will automatically use the correct representation of the path when it*

*interacts with your system, or any user's system.*

***Accessing a File's Lines***

When you're working with a file, you'll often want to examine each line   
of the file. You might be looking for certain information in the file, or  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress225.png)

Files and Exceptions

**187**

you might want to modify the text in the file in some way. For example, you   
might want to read through a file of weather data and work with any line   
that includes the word *sunny* in the description of that day's weather. In a   
news report, you might look for any line with the tag

\<headline\>

and rewrite

that line with a specific kind of formatting.

You can use the

splitlines()

method to turn a long string into a set of

lines, and then use a

for

loop to examine each line from a file, one at a time:

*file_reader.py*

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('pi_digits.txt')

1

contents = path.read_text()

2

lines = contents.splitlines()

for line in lines:  
print(line)

We start out by reading the entire contents of the file, as we did ear-

lier

1

. If you're planning to work with the individual lines in a file, you

don't need to strip any whitespace when reading the file. The

splitlines()

method returns a list of all lines in the file, and we assign this list to the   
variable

lines

2

. We then loop over these lines and print each one:

3.1415926535  
8979323846  
2643383279

Since we haven't modified any of the lines, the output matches the

original text file exactly.

***Working with a File's Contents***

After you've read the contents of a file into memory, you can do whatever   
you want with that data, so let's briefly explore the digits of *pi* . First, we'll   
attempt to build a single string containing all the digits in the file with no   
whitespace in it:

*pi_string.py*

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('pi_digits.txt')  
contents = path.read_text()

lines = contents.splitlines()

pi_string = ''

1

for line in lines:

pi_string += line

print(pi_string)  
print(len(pi_string))

We start by reading the file and storing each line of digits in a list, just

as we did in the previous example. We then create a variable,

pi_string

,  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress226.png)

**188**

Chapter 10

to hold the digits of *pi*. We write a loop that adds each line of digits to

pi_string

1

. We print this string, and also show how long the string is:

3.1415926535 8979323846 2643383279  
36

The variable

pi_string

contains the whitespace that was on the left side

of the digits in each line, but we can get rid of that by using

lstrip()

on

each line:

*--snip--*

for line in lines:  

pi_string += line.lstrip()

print(pi_string)  
print(len(pi_string))

Now we have a string containing *pi* to 30 decimal places. The string

is 32 characters long because it also includes the leading

3

and a decimal

point:

3.141592653589793238462643383279  
32

**N O T E**

*When Python reads from a text file, it interprets all text in the file as a string. If you*

*read in a number and want to work with that value in a numerical context, you'll
have to convert it to an integer using the*

*int()*

*function or a float using the*

*float()*

*function.*

***Large Files: One Million Digits***

So far, we've focused on analyzing a text file that contains only three lines,   
but the code in these examples would work just as well on much larger   
files. If we start with a text file that contains *pi* to 1,000,000 decimal places,   
instead of just 30, we can create a single string containing all these digits.   
We don't need to change our program at all, except to pass it a different   
file. We'll also print just the first 50 decimal places, so we don't have to   
watch a million digits scroll by in the terminal:

*pi_string.py*

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('pi_million_digits.txt')

contents = path.read_text()

lines = contents.splitlines()  
pi_string = ''  
for line in lines:  
pi_string += line.lstrip()

print(f"{pi_string\[:52\]}...")

print(len(pi_string))  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress227.png)

Files and Exceptions

**189**

The output shows that we do indeed have a string containing *pi* to

1,000,000 decimal places:

3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510...  
1000002

Python has no inherent limit to how much data you can work with; you

can work with as much data as your system's memory can handle.

***Is Your Birthday Contained in Pi?***

I've always been curious to know if my birthday appears anywhere in the   
digits of *pi* . Let's use the program we just wrote to find out if someone's   
birthday appears anywhere in the first million digits of *pi* . We can do this   
by expressing each birthday as a string of digits and seeing if that string   
appears anywhere in

pi_string

:

*pi_birthday.py*

*--snip--*

for line in lines:  
pi_string += line.strip()

birthday = input("Enter your birthday, in the form mmddyy: ")  
if birthday in pi_string:  
print("Your birthday appears in the first million digits of pi!")  
else:  
print("Your birthday does not appear in the first million digits of pi.")

We first prompt for the user's birthday, and then check if that string is

in

pi_string

. Let's try it:

Enter your birthdate, in the form mmddyy:

**120372**

Your birthday appears in the first million digits of pi!

My birthday does appear in the digits of *pi*! Once you've read from a

file, you can analyze its contents in just about any way you can imagine.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**10-1. Learning Python:**

Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines

summarizing what you've learned about Python so far. Start each line with the   
phrase

*In Python you can. . .*

. Save the file as

*learning_python.txt*

in the same

directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file   
and prints what you wrote two times: print the contents once by reading in the   
entire file, and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.

**10-2. Learning C:**

You can use the

replace()

method to replace any word in a

string with a different word. Here's a quick example showing how to replace

'dog'

with

'cat'

in a sentence:

\>\>\>

**message = "I really like dogs."**

\>\>\>

**message.replace('dog', 'cat')**

'I really like cats.'

Read in each line from the file you just created,

*learning_python.txt*

, and

replace the word

*Python*

with the name of another language, such as

*C*

. Print

each modified line to the screen.

**10-3. Simpler Code**

: The program

*file_reader.py*

in this section uses a temporary

variable,

lines

, to show how

splitlines()

works. You can skip the temporary

variable and loop directly over the list that

splitlines()

returns:

for line in contents.splitlines():

Remove the temporary variable from each of the programs in this section,

to make them more concise.

**Writing to a File**

One of the simplest ways to save data is to write it to a file. When you write   
text to a file, the output will still be available after you close the terminal   
containing your program's output. You can examine output after a program   
finishes running, and you can share the output files with others as well. You   
can also write programs that read the text back into memory and work with   
it again later.

***Writing a Single Line***

Once you have a path defined, you can write to a file using the

write_text()

method. To see how this works, let's write a simple message and store it in a   
file instead of printing it to the screen:

*write*

*_message.py*

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('programming.txt')  
path.write_text("I love programming.")

The

write_text()

method takes a single argument: the string that you

want to write to the file. This program has no terminal output, but if you   
open the file *programming.txt*, you'll see one line:

*programming.txt*

I love programming.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress229.png)

Files and Exceptions

**191**

This file behaves like any other file on your computer. You can open it,

write new text in it, copy from it, paste to it, and so forth.

**N O T E**

*Python can only write strings to a text file. If you want to store numerical data*

*in a text file, you'll have to convert the data to string format first using the*

*str()*

*function.*

***Writing Multiple Lines***

The

write_text()

method does a few things behind the scenes. If the file that

path

points to doesn't exist, it creates that file. Also, after writing the string

to the file, it makes sure the file is closed properly. Files that aren't closed   
properly can lead to missing or corrupted data.

To write more than one line to a file, you need to build a string contain-

ing the entire contents of the file, and then call

write_text()

with that string.

Let's write several lines to the *programming.txt* file:

from pathlib import Path

contents = "I love programming.\\n"  
contents += "I love creating new games.\\n"  
contents += "I also love working with data.\\n"

path = Path('programming.txt')

path.write_text(contents)

We define a variable called

contents

that will hold the entire contents of

the file. On the next line, we use the

+=

operator to add to this string. You

can do this as many times as you need, to build strings of any length. In this   
case we include newline characters at the end of each line, to make sure   
each statement appears on its own line.

If you run this and then open *programming.txt*, you'll see each of these

lines in the text file:

I love programming.  
I love creating new games.  
I also love working with data.

You can also use spaces, tab characters, and blank lines to format your

output, just as you've been doing with terminal-based output. There's no   
limit to the length of your strings, and this is how many computer-generated   
documents are created.

**N O T E**

*Be careful when calling*

*write_text()*

*on a path object. If the file already exists,*

*write_text()*

*will erase the current contents of the file and write new contents*

*to the file. Later in this chapter, you'll learn to check whether a file exists using*

*pathlib*

*.*

Write a

loop that prompts users for their name. Collect

all the names that are entered, and then write these names to a file called

. Make sure each entry appears on a new line in the file.

**Exceptions**

Python uses special objects called *exceptions* to manage errors that arise dur-  
ing a program's execution. Whenever an error occurs that makes Python   
unsure of what to do next, it creates an exception object. If you write code   
that handles the exception, the program will continue running. If you don't   
handle the exception, the program will halt and show a *traceback* , which   
includes a report of the exception that was raised.

Exceptions are handled with

try

-

except

blocks. A *try* -*except* block asks

Python to do something, but it also tells Python what to do if an excep-  
tion is raised. When you use

try

-

except

blocks, your programs will continue

running even if things start to go wrong. Instead of tracebacks, which can   
be confusing for users to read, users will see friendly error messages that   
you've written.

***Handling the ZeroDivisionError Exception***

Let's look at a simple error that causes Python to raise an exception. You   
probably know that it's impossible to divide a number by zero, but let's ask   
Python to do it anyway:

*division*

*_calculator.py*

print(5/0)

Python can't do this, so we get a traceback:

Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "division_calculator.py", line 1, in \<module\>  
print(5/0)  
\~\^\~

1

ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The error reported in the traceback,

ZeroDivisionError

, is an exception

object

1

. Python creates this kind of object in response to a situation where

it can't do what we ask it to. When this happens, Python stops the program   
and tells us the kind of exception that was raised. We can use this informa-  
tion to modify our program. We'll tell Python what to do when this kind of   
exception occurs; that way, if it happens again, we'll be prepared.

***Using try-except Blocks***

When you think an error may occur, you can write a

try

-

except

block to

handle the exception that might be raised. You tell Python to try running   
some code, and you tell it what to do if the code results in a particular kind   
of exception.

Here's what a

try

-

except

block for handling the

ZeroDivisionError

excep-

tion looks like:

try:  

print(5/0)

except ZeroDivisionError:  
print("You can't divide by zero!")

We put

print(5/0)

, the line that caused the error, inside a

try

block. If

the code in a

try

block works, Python skips over the

except

block. If the code

in the

try

block causes an error, Python looks for an

except

block whose

error matches the one that was raised, and runs the code in that block.

In this example, the code in the

try

block produces a

ZeroDivisionError

,

so Python looks for an

except

block telling it how to respond. Python then

runs the code in that block, and the user sees a friendly error message   
instead of a traceback:

You can't divide by zero!

If more code followed the

try

-

except

block, the program would continue

running because we told Python how to handle the error. Let's look at an   
example where catching an error can allow a program to continue running.

***Using Exceptions to Prevent Crashes***

Handling errors correctly is especially important when the program has   
more work to do after the error occurs. This happens often in programs   
that prompt users for input. If the program responds to invalid input appro-  
priately, it can prompt for more valid input instead of crashing.

Let's create a simple calculator that does only division:

*division*

*_calculator.py*

print("Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.")  
print("Enter 'q' to quit.")

while True:

1

first_number = input("\\nFirst number: ")

if first_number == 'q':  
break

2

second_number = input("Second number: ")

if second_number == 'q':  
break

3

answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)

print(answer)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress232.png)

**194**

Chapter 10

This program prompts the user to input a

first_number

1

and, if the

user does not enter

q

to quit, a

second_number

2

. We then divide these two

numbers to get an

answer

3

. This program does nothing to handle errors,

so asking it to divide by zero causes it to crash:

Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.  
Enter 'q' to quit.

First number:

**5**

Second number:

**0**

Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "division_calculator.py", line 11, in \<module\>  
answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\^\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

It's bad that the program crashed, but it's also not a good idea to let

users see tracebacks. Nontechnical users will be confused by them, and in   
a malicious setting, attackers will learn more than you want them to. For   
example, they'll know the name of your program file, and they'll see a part   
of your code that isn't working properly. A skilled attacker can sometimes   
use this information to determine which kind of attacks to use against   
your code.

***The else Block***

We can make this program more error resistant by wrapping the line that   
might produce errors in a

try

-

except

block. The error occurs on the line

that performs the division, so that's where we'll put the

try

-

except

block.

This example also includes an

else

block. Any code that depends on the

try

block executing successfully goes in the

else

block:

*--snip--*

while True:  

*--snip--*

if second_number == 'q':  
break

1

try:

answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)

2

except ZeroDivisionError:

print("You can't divide by 0!")

3

else:

print(answer)

We ask Python to try to complete the division operation in a

try

block

1

,

which includes only the code that might cause an error. Any code that   
depends on the

try

block succeeding is added to the

else

block. In this case,

if the division operation is successful, we use the

else

block to print the

result

3

.

The

except

block tells Python how to respond when a

ZeroDivisionError

arises

2

. If the

try

block doesn't succeed because of a division-by-zero error,  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress233.png)

Files and Exceptions

**195**

we print a friendly message telling the user how to avoid this kind of error.   
The program continues to run, and the user never sees a traceback:

Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.  
Enter 'q' to quit.

First number:

**5**

Second number:

**0**

You can't divide by 0!

First number:

**5**

Second number:

**2**

2.5

First number:

**q**

The only code that should go in a

try

block is code that might cause an

exception to be raised. Sometimes you'll have additional code that should   
run only if the

try

block was successful; this code goes in the

else

block.

The

except

block tells Python what to do in case a certain exception arises

when it tries to run the code in the

try

block.

By anticipating likely sources of errors, you can write robust programs

that continue to run even when they encounter invalid data and missing   
resources. Your code will be resistant to innocent user mistakes and mali-  
cious attacks.

***Handling the FileNotFoundError Exception***

One common issue when working with files is handling missing files. The   
file you're looking for might be in a different location, the filename might   
be misspelled, or the file might not exist at all. You can handle all of these   
situations with a

try

-

except

block.

Let's try to read a file that doesn't exist. The following program tries to

read in the contents of *Alice in Wonderland* , but I haven't saved the file *alice.txt*   
in the same directory as *alice.py*:

*alice.py*

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('alice.txt')  
contents = path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')

Note that we're using

read_text()

in a slightly different way here than

what you saw earlier. The

encoding

argument is needed when your system's

default encoding doesn't match the encoding of the file that's being read.   
This is most likely to happen when reading from a file that wasn't created   
on your system.

Python can't read from a missing file, so it raises an exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):

1

File "alice.py", line 4, in \<module\>

2

contents = path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')

\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress234.png)

FileNotFoundError: \[Errno 2\] No such file or directory: 'alice.txt'

This is a longer traceback than the ones we've seen previously, so let's

look at how you can make sense of more complex tracebacks. It's often best   
to start at the very end of the traceback. On the last line, we can see that a

FileNotFoundError

exception was raised

3

. This is important because it tells

us what kind of exception to use in the

except

block that we'll write.

Looking back near the beginning of the traceback

1

, we can see that

the error occurred at line 4 in the file *alice.py* . The next line shows the line   
of code that caused the error

2

. The rest of the traceback shows some code

from the libraries that are involved in opening and reading from files. You   
don't usually need to read through or understand all of these lines in a   
traceback.

To handle the error that's being raised, the

try

block will begin with

the line that was identified as problematic in the traceback. In our example,   
this is the line that contains

read_text()

:

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('alice.txt')

try:  

contents = path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')

1

except FileNotFoundError:

print(f"Sorry, the file {path} does not exist.")

In this example, the code in the

try

block produces a

FileNotFoundError

,

so we write an

except

block that matches that error

1

. Python then runs the

code in that block when the file can't be found, and the result is a friendly   
error message instead of a traceback:

Sorry, the file alice.txt does not exist.

The program has nothing more to do if the file doesn't exist, so this

is all the output we see. Let's build on this example and see how exception   
handling can help when you're working with more than one file.

***Analyzing Text***

You can analyze text files containing entire books. Many classic works of   
literature are available as simple text files because they are in the pub-  
lic domain. The texts used in this section come from Project Gutenberg   
[(*https://gutenberg.org*](https://gutenberg.org)). Project Gutenberg maintains a collection of literary   
works that are available in the public domain, and it's a great resource   
if you're interested in working with literary texts in your programming   
projects.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress235.png)

Files and Exceptions

**197**

Let's pull in the text of *Alice in Wonderland* and try to count the number

of words in the text. To do this, we'll use the string method

split()

, which

by default splits a string wherever it finds any whitespace:

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('alice.txt')  
try:  
contents = path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')  
except FileNotFoundError:  
print(f"Sorry, the file {path} does not exist.")

else:  
# Count the approximate number of words in the file:

1

words = contents.split()

2

num_words = len(words)

print(f"The file {path} has about {num_words} words.")

I moved the file *alice.txt* to the correct directory, so the

try

block will

work this time. We take the string

contents

, which now contains the entire

text of *Alice in Wonderland* as one long string, and use

split()

to produce a

list of all the words in the book

1

. Using

len()

on this list

2

gives us a good

approximation of the number of words in the original text. Lastly, we print   
a statement that reports how many words were found in the file. This code   
is placed in the

else

block because it only works if the code in the

try

block

was executed successfully.

The output tells us how many words are in *alice.txt*:

The file alice.txt has about 29594 words.

The count is a little high because extra information is provided by the

publisher in the text file used here, but it's a good approximation of the   
length of *Alice in Wonderland*.

***Working with Multiple Files***

Let's add more books to analyze, but before we do, let's move the bulk of   
this program to a function called

count_words()

. This will make it easier to

run the analysis for multiple books:

*word_count.py*

from pathlib import Path

def count_words(path):

1

"""Count the approximate number of words in a file."""

try:

contents = path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')  
except FileNotFoundError:  
print(f"Sorry, the file {path} does not exist.")  
else:  
# Count the approximate number of words in the file:  
words = contents.split()  
num_words = len(words)  
print(f"The file {path} has about {num_words} words.")  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress236.png)

**198**

Chapter 10

path = Path('alice.txt')

count_words(path)

Most of this code is unchanged. It's only been indented, and moved

into the body of

count_words()

. It's a good habit to keep comments up to date

when you're modifying a program, so the comment has also been changed   
to a docstring and reworded slightly

1

.

Now we can write a short loop to count the words in any text we want to

analyze. We do this by storing the names of the files we want to analyze in a   
list, and then we call

count_words()

for each file in the list. We'll try to count

the words for *Alice in Wonderland* , *Siddhartha* , *Moby Dick* , and *Little Women* ,   
which are all available in the public domain. I've intentionally left *siddhartha.txt*   
out of the directory containing *word_count.py* , so we can see how well our   
program handles a missing file:

from pathlib import Path

def count_words(filename):  

*--snip--*

filenames = \['alice.txt', 'siddhartha.txt', 'moby_dick.txt',   
'little_women.txt'\]  
for filename in filenames:

1

path = Path(filename)

count_words(path)

The names of the files are stored as simple strings. Each string is then

converted to a

Path

object

1

, before the call to

count_words()

. The missing

*siddhartha.txt* file has no effect on the rest of the program's execution:

The file alice.txt has about 29594 words.  
Sorry, the file siddhartha.txt does not exist.  
The file moby_dick.txt has about 215864 words.  
The file little_women.txt has about 189142 words.

Using the

try

-

except

block in this example provides two significant

advantages. We prevent our users from seeing a traceback, and we let the   
program continue analyzing the texts it's able to find. If we don't catch   
the

FileNotFoundError

that *siddhartha.txt* raises, the user would see a full

traceback, and the program would stop running after trying to analyze   
*Siddhartha* . It would never analyze *Moby Dick* or *Little Women*.

***Failing Silently***

In the previous example, we informed our users that one of the files   
was unavailable. But you don't need to report every exception you catch.   
Sometimes, you'll want the program to fail silently when an exception   
occurs and continue on as if nothing happened. To make a program fail   
silently, you write a

try

block as usual, but you explicitly tell Python to do  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress237.png)

Files and Exceptions

**199**

nothing in the

except

block. Python has a

pass

statement that tells it to

do nothing in a block:

def count_words(path):  
"""Count the approximate number of words in a file."""  
try:  

*--snip--*

except FileNotFoundError:

pass

else:  

*--snip--*

The only difference between this listing and the previous one is the

pass

statement in the

except

block. Now when a

FileNotFoundError

is raised, the

code in the

except

block runs, but nothing happens. No traceback is pro-

duced, and there's no output in response to the error that was raised. Users   
see the word counts for each file that exists, but they don't see any indica-  
tion that a file wasn't found:

The file alice.txt has about 29594 words.  
The file moby_dick.txt has about 215864 words.  
The file little_women.txt has about 189142 words.

The

pass

statement also acts as a placeholder. It's a reminder that

you're choosing to do nothing at a specific point in your program's execu-  
tion and that you might want to do something there later. For example,   
in this program we might decide to write any missing filenames to a file   
called *missing_files.txt* . Our users wouldn't see this file, but we'd be able to   
read the file and deal with any missing texts.

***Deciding Which Errors to Report***

How do you know when to report an error to your users and when to let   
your program fail silently? If users know which texts are supposed to be   
analyzed, they might appreciate a message informing them why some texts   
were not analyzed. If users expect to see some results but don't know which   
books are supposed to be analyzed, they might not need to know that some   
texts were unavailable. Giving users information they aren't looking for   
can decrease the usability of your program. Python's error-handling struc-  
tures give you fine-grained control over how much to share with users when   
things go wrong; it's up to you to decide how much information to share.

Well-written, properly tested code is not very prone to internal errors,

such as syntax or logical errors. But every time your program depends on   
something external such as user input, the existence of a file, or the avail-  
ability of a network connection, there is a possibility of an exception being   
raised. A little experience will help you know where to include exception-  
handling blocks in your program and how much to report to users about   
errors that arise.

Chapter 10

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**10-6. Addition:**

One common problem when prompting for numerical input

occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert   
the input to an

int

, you'll get a

ValueError

. Write a program that prompts for

two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the

ValueError

if

either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your   
program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a   
number.

**10-7. Addition Calculator:**

Wrap your code from Exercise 10-5 in a

while

loop

so the user can continue entering numbers, even if they make a mistake and   
enter text instead of a number.

**10-8. Cats and Dogs:**

Make two files,

*cats.txt*

and

*dogs.txt*

. Store at least three

names of cats in the first file and three names of dogs in the second file. Write   
a program that tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the   
screen. Wrap your code in a

try-except

block to catch the

FileNotFound

error,

and print a friendly message if a file is missing. Move one of the files to a dif-  
ferent location on your system, and make sure the code in the

except

block

executes properly.

**10-9. Silent Cats and Dogs:**

Modify your

except

block in Exercise 10-7 to fail

silently if either file is missing.

**10-10. Common Words:**

Visit Project Gutenber[g (](https://gutenberg.orgâ)

[*https://gutenberg.org*](https://gutenberg.orgâ)

) and find

a few texts you'd like to analyze. Download the text files for these works, or   
copy the raw text from your browser into a text file on your computer.

You can use the

count()

method to find out how many times a word or

phrase appears in a string. For example, the following code counts the number   
of times

'row'

appears in a string:

\>\>\>

**line = "Row, row, row your boat"**

\>\>\>

**line.count('row')**

2  
\>\>\>

**line.lower().count('row')**

3

Notice that converting the string to lowercase using

lower()

catches all

appearances of the word you're looking for, regardless of how it's formatted.

Write a program that reads the files you found at Project Gutenberg and

determines how many times the word

'the'

appears in each text. This will be

an approximation because it will also count words such as

'then'

and

'there'

.

Try counting

'the '

, with a space in the string, and see how much lower your

count is.

Files and Exceptions

**201**

**Storing Data**

Many of your programs will ask users to input certain kinds of information.   
You might allow users to store preferences in a game or provide data for a visu-  
alization. Whatever the focus of your program is, you'll store the information   
users provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. When users close   
a program, you'll almost always want to save the information they entered. A   
simple way to do this involves storing your data using the

json

module.

The

json

module allows you to convert simple Python data structures

into JSON-formatted strings, and then load the data from that file the next   
time the program runs. You can also use

json

to share data between differ-

ent Python programs. Even better, the JSON data format is not specific to   
Python, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people   
who work in many other programming languages. It's a useful and portable   
format, and it's easy to learn.

**N O T E**

*The*

JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)*format was originally developed for*

*JavaScript. However, it has since become a common format used by many languages,
including Python.*

***Using json.dumps() and json.loads()***

Let's write a short program that stores a set of numbers and another pro-  
gram that reads these numbers back into memory. The first program will   
use

json.dumps()

to store the set of numbers, and the second program will use

json.loads()

.

The

json.dumps()

function takes one argument: a piece of data that should

be converted to the JSON format. The function returns a string, which we can   
then write to a data file:

*number*

*_writer.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

numbers = \[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\]

1

path = Path('numbers.json')

2

contents = json.dumps(numbers)

path.write_text(contents)

We first import the

json

module, and then create a list of numbers to

work with. Then we choose a filename in which to store the list of num-  
bers

1

. It's customary to use the file extension *.json* to indicate that the data

in the file is stored in the JSON format. Next, we use the

json.dumps()

2

function to generate a string containing the JSON representation of the   
data we're working with. Once we have this string, we write it to the file   
using the same

write_text()

method we used earlier.

This program has no output, but let's open the file *numbers.json* and

look at it. The data is stored in a format that looks just like Python:

\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\]  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress240.png)

**202**

Chapter 10

Now we'll write a separate program that uses

json.loads()

to read the

list back into memory:

*number*

*_reader.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

1

path = Path('numbers.json')

2

contents = path.read_text()

3

numbers = json.loads(contents)

print(numbers)

We make sure to read from the same file we wrote to

1

. Since the data

file is just a text file with specific formatting, we can read it with the

read_text()

method

2

. We then pass the contents of the file to

json.loads()

3

. This func-

tion takes in a JSON-formatted string and returns a Python object (in this   
case, a list), which we assign to

numbers

. Finally, we print the recovered list of

numbers and see that it's the same list created in *number_writer.py*:

\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\]

This is a simple way to share data between two programs.

***Saving and Reading User-Generated Data***

Saving data with

json

is useful when you're working with user-generated

data, because if you don't store your user's information somehow, you'll   
lose it when the program stops running. Let's look at an example where we   
prompt the user for their name the first time they run a program and then   
remember their name when they run the program again.

Let's start by storing the user's name:

*remember*

*_me.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

1

username = input("What is your name? ")

2

path = Path('username.json')

contents = json.dumps(username)  
path.write_text(contents)

3

print(f"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!")

We first prompt for a username to store

1

. Next, we write the data

we just collected to a file called *username.json*

2

. Then we print a message

informing the user that we've stored their information

3

:

What is your name?

**Eric**

We'll remember you when you come back, Eric!

Files and Exceptions

**203**

Now let's write a new program that greets a user whose name has

already been stored:

*greet_user.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

1

path = Path('username.json')

contents = path.read_text()

2

username = json.loads(contents)

print(f"Welcome back, {username}!")

We read the contents of the data file

1

and then use

json.loads()

to

assign the recovered data to the variable

username

2

. Since we've recovered

the username, we can welcome the user back with a personalized greeting:

Welcome back, Eric!

We need to combine these two programs into one file. When someone

runs *remember_me.py* , we want to retrieve their username from memory if   
possible; if not, we'll prompt for a username and store it in *username.json* for   
next time. We could write a

try

-

except

block here to respond appropriately

if *username.json* doesn't exist, but instead we'll use a handy method from the

pathlib

module:

*remember*

*_me.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

path = Path('username.json')

1

if path.exists():

contents = path.read_text()  
username = json.loads(contents)  
print(f"Welcome back, {username}!")

2

else:

username = input("What is your name? ")  
contents = json.dumps(username)  
path.write_text(contents)  
print(f"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!")

There are many helpful methods you can use with

Path

objects. The

exists()

method returns

True

if a file or folder exists and

False

if it doesn't.

Here we use

path.exists()

to find out if a username has already been stored

1

.

If *username.json* exists, we load the username and print a personalized greeting   
to the user.

If the file *username.json* doesn't exist

2

, we prompt for a username and

store the value that the user enters. We also print the familiar message that   
we'll remember them when they come back.

Whichever block executes, the result is a username and an appropriate

greeting. If this is the first time the program runs, this is the output:

What is your name?

**Eric**

We'll remember you when you come back, Eric!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress242.png)

**204**

Chapter 10

Otherwise:

Welcome back, Eric!

This is the output you see if the program was already run at least once.

Even though the data in this section is just a single string, the program   
would work just as well with any data that can be converted to a JSON-  
formatted string.

***Refactoring***

Often, you'll come to a point where your code will work, but you'll recognize   
that you could improve the code by breaking it up into a series of functions   
that have specific jobs. This process is called *refactoring* . Refactoring makes   
your code cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to extend.

We can refactor *remember_me.py* by moving the bulk of its logic into one

or more functions. The focus of *remember_me.py* is on greeting the user, so   
let's move all of our existing code into a function called

greet_user()

:

*remember*

*_me.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

def greet_user():

1

"""Greet the user by name."""

path = Path('username.json')

if path.exists():  
contents = path.read_text()  
username = json.loads(contents)  
print(f"Welcome back, {username}!")  
else:  
username = input("What is your name? ")  
contents = json.dumps(username)  
path.write_text(contents)  
print(f"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!")

greet_user()

Because we're using a function now, we rewrite the comments as a doc-

string that reflects how the program currently works

1

. This file is a little

cleaner, but the function

greet_user()

is doing more than just greeting the

user---it's also retrieving a stored username if one exists and prompting for   
a new username if one doesn't.

Let's refactor

greet_user()

so it's not doing so many different tasks. We'll

start by moving the code for retrieving a stored username to a separate   
function:

from pathlib import Path  
import json

def get_stored_username(path):

1

"""Get stored username if available."""  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress243.png)

Files and Exceptions

**205**

if path.exists():

contents = path.read_text()  
username = json.loads(contents)

return username  
else:

2

return None

def greet_user():  
"""Greet the user by name."""

path = Path('username.json')

username = get_stored_username(path)

3

if username:

print(f"Welcome back, {username}!")

else:

username = input("What is your name? ")  
contents = json.dumps(username)  
path.write_text(contents)  
print(f"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!")

greet_user()

The new function

get_stored_username()

1

has a clear purpose, as stated

in the docstring. This function retrieves a stored username and returns the   
username if it finds one. If the path that's passed to

get_stored_username()

doesn't exist, the function returns

None

2

. This is good practice: a function

should either return the value you're expecting, or it should return

None

.

This allows us to perform a simple test with the return value of the func-  
tion. We print a welcome back message to the user if the attempt to retrieve   
a username is successful

3

, and if it isn't, we prompt for a new username.

We should factor one more block of code out of

greet_user()

. If the user-

name doesn't exist, we should move the code that prompts for a new username   
to a function dedicated to that purpose:

from pathlib import Path  
import json

def get_stored_username(path):  
"""Get stored username if available."""

*--snip--*

def get_new_username(path):  
"""Prompt for a new username."""  

username = input("What is your name? ")

contents = json.dumps(username)  
path.write_text(contents)

return username

def greet_user():  
"""Greet the user by name."""  
path = Path('username.json')

1

username = get_stored_username(path)

if username:  
print(f"Welcome back, {username}!")  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress244.png)

**206**

Chapter 10

else:

2

username = get_new_username(path)

print(f"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!")

greet_user()

Each function in this final version of *remember_me.py* has a single, clear

purpose. We call

greet_user()

, and that function prints an appropriate mes-

sage: it either welcomes back an existing user or greets a new user. It does   
this by calling

get_stored_username()

1

, which is responsible only for retriev-

ing a stored username if one exists. Finally, if necessary,

greet_user()

calls

get_new_username()

2

, which is responsible only for getting a new username

and storing it. This compartmentalization of work is an essential part of   
writing clear code that will be easy to maintain and extend.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**10-11. Favorite Number:**

Write a program that prompts for the user's favorite

number. Use

json.dumps()

to store this number in a file. Write a separate pro-

gram that reads in this value and prints the message "I know your favorite   
number! It's _____."

**10-12. Favorite Number Remembered:**

Combine the two programs you wrote in

Exercise 10-11 into one file. If the number is already stored, report the favorite   
number to the user. If not, prompt for the user's favorite number and store it in a   
file. Run the program twice to see that it works.

**10-13. User Dictionary:**

The

*remember_me.py*

example only stores one piece of

information, the username. Expand this example by asking for two more pieces   
of information about the user, then store all the information you collect in a   
dictionary. Write this dictionary to a file using

json.dumps()

, and read it back

in using

json.loads()

. Print a summary showing exactly what your program

remembers about the user.

**10-14. Verify User:**

The final listing for

*remember_me.py*

assumes either that the

user has already entered their username or that the program is running for the   
first time. We should modify it in case the current user is not the person who last   
used the program.

Before printing a welcome back message in

greet_user()

, ask the user if

this is the correct username. If it's not, call

get_new_username()

to get the correct

username.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to work with files. You learned to read the   
entire contents of a file, and then work through the contents one line at a   
time if you need to. You learned to write as much text as you want to a file.   
You also read about exceptions and how to handle the exceptions you're   
likely to see in your programs. Finally, you learned how to store Python data   
structures so you can save information your users provide, preventing them   
from having to start over each time they run a program.

I[n Chapter 11,](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#247)you'll learn efficient ways to test your code. This will help

you trust that the code you develop is correct, and it will help you identify   
bugs that are introduced as you continue to build on the programs you've   
written.

**T E S T I N G Y O U R C O D E**

When you write a function or a class, you

can also write tests for that code. Testing

proves that your code works as it's supposed

to in response to all the kinds of input it's

designed to receive. When you write tests, you can be   
confident that your code will work correctly as more

people begin to use your programs. You'll also be able to test new code as   
you add it, to make sure your changes don't break your program's existing   
behavior. Every programmer makes mistakes, so every programmer must   
test their code often, to catch problems before users encounter them.

In this chapter, you'll learn to test your code using

pytest

. The

pytest

library is a collection of tools that will help you write your first tests quickly   
and simply, while supporting your tests as they grow in complexity along   
with your projects. Python doesn't include

pytest

by default, so you'll learn

to install external libraries. Knowing how to install external libraries will   
make a wide variety of well-designed code available to you. These libraries   
will expand the kinds of projects you can work on immensely.

Chapter 11

You'll learn to build a series of tests and check that each set of inputs

results in the output you want. You'll see what a passing test looks like and   
what a failing test looks like, and you'll learn how a failing test can help you   
improve your code. You'll learn to test functions and classes, and you'll start   
to understand how many tests to write for a project.

**Installing pytest with pip**

While Python includes a lot of functionality in the standard library, Python   
developers also depend heavily on third-party packages. A *third-party package*   
is a library that's developed outside the core Python language. Some popu-  
lar third-party libraries are eventually adopted into the standard library,   
and end up being included in most Python installations from that point   
forward. This happens most often with libraries that are unlikely to change   
much once they've had their initial bugs worked out. These kinds of librar-  
ies can evolve at the same pace as the overall language.

Many packages, however, are kept out of the standard library so they can

be developed on a timeline independent of the language itself. These pack-  
ages tend to be updated more frequently than they would be if they were   
tied to Python's development schedule. This is true of

pytest

and most of the

libraries we'll use in the second half of this book. You shouldn't blindly trust   
every third-party package, but you also shouldn't be put off by the fact that a   
lot of important functionality is implemented through such packages.

***Updating pip***

Python includes a tool called pip that's used to install third-party packages.   
Because pip helps install packages from external resources, it's updated   
often to address potential security issues. So, we'll start by updating pip.

Open a new terminal window and issue the following command:

$

**python -m pip install --upgrade pip**

1

Requirement already satisfied: pip in /.../python3.11/site-packages (22.0.4)

*--snip--*

2

Successfully installed pip-22.1.2

The first part of this command,

**python -m pip**

, tells Python to run the

module

pip

. The second part,

**install --upgrade**

, tells pip to update a package

that's already been installed. The last part,

**pip**

, specifies which third-party

package should be updated. The output shows that my current version of   
pip, version 22.0.4

1

, was replaced by the latest version at the time of this

writing, 22.1.2

2

.

You can use this command to update any third-party package installed

on your system:

$

**python -m pip install --upgrade**

***package_name***

**N O T E**

*If you're using Linux, pip may not be included with your installation of Python. If*

*you get an error when trying to upgrade pip, see the instructions in [Appendix A.](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#501)*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress249.png)

Testing Your Code

**211**

***Installing pytest***

Now that pip is up to date, we can install

pytest

:

$

**python -m pip install --user pytest**

Collecting pytest

*--snip--*

Successfully installed attrs-21.4.0 iniconfig-1.1.1 ...pytest-7.

*x*

.

*x*

We're still using the core command

**pip install**

, without the

**--upgrade**

flag this time. Instead, we're using the

**--user**

flag, which tells Python to

install this package for the current user only. The output shows that the lat-  
est version of

pytest

was successfully installed, along with a number of other

packages that

pytest

depends on.

You can use this command to install many third-party packages:

$

**python -m pip install --user**

***package_name***

**N O T E**

*If you have any difficulty running this command, try running the same command*

*without the*

***--user***

*flag.*

**Testing a Function**

To learn about testing, we need code to test. Here's a simple function that   
takes in a first and last name, and returns a neatly formatted full name:

*name*

*_function.py*

def get_formatted_name(first, last):  
"""Generate a neatly formatted full name."""  
full_name = f"{first} {last}"  
return full_name.title()

The function

get_formatted_name()

combines the first and last name

with a space in between to complete a full name, and then capitalizes and   
returns the full name. To check that

get_formatted_name()

works, let's make

a program that uses this function. The program *names.py* lets users enter a   
first and last name, and see a neatly formatted full name:

*names.py*

from name_function import get_formatted_name

print("Enter 'q' at any time to quit.")  
while True:  
first = input("\\nPlease give me a first name: ")  
if first == 'q':  
break  
last = input("Please give me a last name: ")  
if last == 'q':  
break

formatted_name = get_formatted_name(first, last)  
print(f"\\tNeatly formatted name: {formatted_name}.")  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress250.png)

**212**

Chapter 11

This program imports

get_formatted_name()

from *name_function.py*. The

user can enter a series of first and last names and see the formatted full   
names that are generated:

Enter 'q' at any time to quit.

Please give me a first name:

**janis**

Please give me a last name:

**joplin**

Neatly formatted name: Janis Joplin.

Please give me a first name:

**bob**

Please give me a last name:

**dylan**

Neatly formatted name: Bob Dylan.

Please give me a first name:

**q**

We can see that the names generated here are correct. But say we want

to modify

get_formatted_name()

so it can also handle middle names. As we

do so, we want to make sure we don't break the way the function handles   
names that have only a first and last name. We could test our code by run-  
ning *names.py* and entering a name like

Janis Joplin

every time we modify

get_formatted_name()

, but that would become tedious. Fortunately,

pytest

provides an efficient way to automate the testing of a function's output. If   
we automate the testing of

get_formatted_name()

, we can always be confident

that the function will work when given the kinds of names we've written   
tests for.

***Unit Tests and Test Cases***

There is a wide variety of approaches to testing software. One of the sim-  
plest kinds of test is a unit test. A *unit test* verifies that one specific aspect of   
a function's behavior is correct. A *test case* is a collection of unit tests that   
together prove that a function behaves as it's supposed to, within the full   
range of situations you expect it to handle.

A good test case considers all the possible kinds of input a function

could receive and includes tests to represent each of these situations. A test   
case with *full coverage* includes a full range of unit tests covering all the pos-  
sible ways you can use a function. Achieving full coverage on a large project   
can be daunting. It's often good enough to write tests for your code's criti-  
cal behaviors and then aim for full coverage only if the project starts to see   
widespread use.

***A Passing Test***

With

pytest

, writing your first unit test is pretty straightforward. We'll

write a single test function. The test function will call the function we're   
testing, and we'll make an assertion about the value that's returned. If our   
assertion is correct, the test will pass; if the assertion is incorrect, the test   
will fail.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress251.png)

Testing Your Code

**213**

Here's the first test of the function

get_formatted_name()

:

*test_name*

*_function.py*

from name_function import get_formatted_name

1

def test_first_last_name():

"""Do names like 'Janis Joplin' work?"""

2

formatted_name = get_formatted_name('janis', 'joplin')

3

assert formatted_name == 'Janis Joplin'

Before we run the test, let's take a closer look at this function. The

name of a test file is important; it must start with *test_*. When we ask

pytest

to run the tests we've written, it will look for any file that begins with *test_* ,   
and run all of the tests it finds in that file.

In the test file, we first import the function that we want to test:

get

_formatted_name()

. Then we define a test function: in this case,

test_first

_last_name()

1

. This is a longer function name than we've been using, for

a good reason. First, test functions need to start with the word *test* ,   
followed by an underscore. Any function that starts with

test_

will be

*discovered* by

pytest

, and will be run as part of the testing process.

Also, test names should be longer and more descriptive than a typical

function name. You'll never call the function yourself;

pytest

will find the

function and run it for you. Test function names should be long enough   
that if you see the function name in a test report, you'll have a good sense   
of what behavior was being tested.

Next, we call the function we're testing

2

. Here we call

get_formatted

_name()

with the arguments

'janis'

and

'joplin'

, just like we used when we

ran *names.py*. We assign the return value of this function to

formatted_name

.

Finally, we make an assertion

3

. An *assertion* is a claim about a condi-

tion. Here we're claiming that the value of

formatted_name

should be

'Janis

Joplin'

.

***Running a Test***

If you run the file *test_name_function.py* directly, you won't get any output   
because we never called the test function. Instead, we'll have

pytest

run the

test file for us.

To do this, open a terminal window and navigate to the folder that con-

tains the test file. If you're using VS Code, you can open the folder containing   
the test file and use the terminal that's embedded in the editor window. In the   
terminal window, enter the command

**pytest**

. Here's what you should see:

$

**pytest**

**214**

Chapter 11

Let's try to make sense of this output. First of all, we see some information

about the system the test is running on

1

. I'm testing this on a macOS system,

so you may see some different output here. Most importantly, we can see which   
versions of Python,

pytest

, and other packages are being used to run the test.

Next, we see the directory where the test is being run from

2

: in my

case, *python_work/chapter_11*. We can see that

pytest

found one test to run

3

,

and we can see the test file that's being run

4

. The single dot after the

name of the file tells us that a single test passed, and the

100%

makes it clear

that all of the tests have been run. A large project can have hundreds or   
thousands of tests, and the dots and percentage-complete indicator can be   
helpful in monitoring the overall progress of the test run.

The last line tells us that one test passed, and it took less than 0.01 sec-

onds to run the test.

This output indicates that the function

get_formatted_name()

will always

work for names that have a first and last name, unless we modify the func-  
tion. When we modify

get_formatted_name()

, we can run this test again. If the

test passes, we know the function will still work for names like Janis Joplin.

***A Failing Test***

What does a failing test look like? Let's modify

get_formatted_name()

so it can

handle middle names, but let's do so in a way that breaks the function for   
names with just a first and last name, like Janis Joplin.

Here's a new version of

get_formatted_name()

that requires a middle name

argument:

*name*

*_function.py*

def get_formatted_name(first, middle, last):  

"""Generate a neatly formatted full name."""

full_name = f"{first} {middle} {last}"  

return full_name.title()

This version should work for people with middle names, but when we

test it, we see that we've broken the function for people with just a first and   
last name.

This time, running

**pytest**

gives the following output:

$

**pytest**

, which tells us that one test failed. We then see a section that focuses

on

FAILURES

2

, because failed tests are usually the most important thing to

focus on in a test run. Next, we see that

test_first_last_name()

was the test

function that failed

3

. An angle bracket

4

indicates the line of code that

caused the test to fail. The

E

on the next line

5

shows the actual error that

caused the failure: a

TypeError

due to a missing required positional argument,

last

. The most important information is repeated in a shorter summary at

the end, so when you're running many tests, you can get a quick sense of   
which tests failed and why.

***Responding to a Failed Test***

What do you do when a test fails? Assuming you're checking the right condi-  
tions, a passing test means the function is behaving correctly and a failing   
test means there's an error in the new code you wrote. So when a test fails,   
don't change the test. If you do, your tests might pass, but any code that   
calls your function like the test does will suddenly stop working. Instead,   
fix the code that's causing the test to fail. Examine the changes you just   
made to the function, and figure out how those changes broke the desired   
behavior.

In this case,

get_formatted_name()

used to require only two parameters: a

first name and a last name. Now it requires a first name, middle name, and   
last name. The addition of that mandatory middle name parameter broke   
the original behavior of

get_formatted_name()

. The best option here is to

make the middle name optional. Once we do, our test for names like

Janis

Joplin

should pass again, and we should be able to accept middle names as

well. Let's modify

get_formatted_name()

so middle names are optional and

then run the test case again. If it passes, we'll move on to making sure the   
function handles middle names properly.

To make middle names optional, we move the parameter

middle

to the

end of the parameter list in the function definition and give it an empty   
default value. We also add an

if

test that builds the full name properly,

depending on whether a middle name is provided:

*name*

*_function.py*

def get_formatted_name(first, last, middle=''):  

"""Generate a neatly formatted full name."""

if middle:  
full_name = f"{first} {middle} {last}"  
else:  
full_name = f"{first} {last}"  

return full_name.title()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress254.png)

**216**

Chapter 11

In this new version of

get_formatted_name()

, the middle name is optional.

If a middle name is passed to the function, the full name will contain a first,   
middle, and last name. Otherwise, the full name will consist of just a first   
and last name. Now the function should work for both kinds of names. To   
find out if the function still works for names like

Janis Joplin

, let's run the

test again:

$

**pytest**

========================= test session starts =========================

*--snip--*

test_name_function.py . \[100%\]  
========================== 1 passed in 0.00s ==========================

The test passes now. This is ideal; it means the function works for

names like

Janis Joplin

again, without us having to test the function

manually. Fixing our function was easier because the failed test helped   
us identify how the new code broke existing behavior.

***Adding New Tests***

Now that we know

get_formatted_name()

works for simple names again, let's

write a second test for people who include a middle name. We do this by   
adding another test function to the file *test_name_function.py*:

*test_name*

*_function.py*

from name_function import get_formatted_name

def test_first_last_name():  

*--snip--*

def test_first_last_middle_name():  
"""Do names like 'Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart' work?"""

1

formatted_name = get_formatted_name(

'wolfgang', 'mozart', 'amadeus')

2

assert formatted_name == 'Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart'

We name this new function

test_first_last_middle_name()

. The function

name must start with

test_

so the function runs automatically when we run

**pytest**

. We name the function to make it clear which behavior of

get_formatted

_name()

we're testing. As a result, if the test fails, we'll know right away what

kinds of names are affected.

To test the function, we call

get_formatted_name()

with a first, last, and

middle name

1

, and then we make an assertion

2

that the returned full

name matches the full name (first, middle, and last) that we expect. When   
we run

**pytest**

again, both tests pass:

$ pytest  
========================= test session starts =========================

*--snip--*

collected 2 items

test_name_function.py .. \[100%\]

========================== 2 passed in 0.01s ==========================

Testing Your Code

**217**

The two dots

1

indicate that two tests passed, which is also clear from

the last line of output. This is great! We now know that the function still   
works for names like

Janis Joplin

, and we can be confident that it will work

for names like

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

as well.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**11-1. City, Country:**

Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name

and a country name. The function should return a single string of the form

*City, Country*

, such as

Santiago, Chile

. Store the function in a module called

*city_functions.py*

, and save this file in a new folder so

pytest

won't try to run the

tests we've already written.

Create a file called

*test_cities.py*

that tests the function you just wrote.

Write a function called

test_city_country()

to verify that calling your function

with values such as

'santiago'

and

'chile'

results in the correct string. Run the

test, and make sure

test_city_country()

passes.

**11-2. Population:**

Modify your function so it requires a third parameter,

population

.

It should now return a single string of the form

*City, Country -- population xxx*

,

such as

Santiago, Chile -- population 5000000

. Run the test again, and make sure

test_city_country()

fails this time.

Modify the function so the

population

parameter is optional. Run the test,

and make sure

test_city_country()

passes again.

Write a second test called

test_city_country_population()

that verifies

you can call your function with the values

'santiago'

,

'chile'

, and

'population

=5000000'

. Run the tests one more time, and make sure this new test passes.

**Testing a Class**

In the first part of this chapter, you wrote tests for a single function. Now   
you'll write tests for a class. You'll use classes in many of your own pro-  
grams, so it's helpful to be able to prove that your classes work correctly. If   
you have passing tests for a class you're working on, you can be confident   
that improvements you make to the class won't accidentally break its cur-  
rent behavior.

***A Variety of Assertions***

So far, you've seen just one kind of assertion: a claim that a string has a   
specific value. When writing a test, you can make any claim that can be   
expressed as a conditional statement. If the condition is

True

as expected,

your assumption about how that part of your program behaves will be   
confirmed; you can be confident that no errors exist. If the condition you  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress256.png)

**218**

Chapter 11

assume is

True

is actually

False

, the test will fail and you'll know there's an

issue to resolve. Table 11-1 shows some of the most useful kinds of assertions   
you can include in your initial tests.

**Table 11-1:**

Commonly Used Assertion Statements in Tests

**Assertion**

**Claim**

assert a == b

Assert that two values are equal.

assert a != b

Assert that two values are not equal.

assert a

Assert that

a

evaluates to

True

.

assert not a

Assert that

a

evaluates to

False

.

assert

*element*

in

*list*

Assert that an element is in a list.

assert

*element*

not in

*list*

Assert that an element is not in a list.

These are just a few examples; anything that can be expressed as a con-

ditional statement can be included in a test.

***A Class to Test***

Testing a class is similar to testing a function, because much of the work   
involves testing the behavior of the methods in the class. However, there   
are a few differences, so let's write a class to test. Consider a class that helps   
administer anonymous surveys:

*survey.py*

class AnonymousSurvey:  
"""Collect anonymous answers to a survey question."""

1

def __init__(self, question):

"""Store a question, and prepare to store responses."""  
self.question = question  
self.responses = \[\]

2

def show_question(self):

"""Show the survey question."""  
print(self.question)

3

def store_response(self, new_response):

"""Store a single response to the survey."""  
self.responses.append(new_response)

4

def show_results(self):

"""Show all the responses that have been given."""  
print("Survey results:")  
for response in self.responses:  
print(f"- {response}")

This class starts with a survey question that you provide

1

and includes

an empty list to store responses. The class has methods to print the survey   
question

2

, add a new response to the response list

3

, and print all the

responses stored in the list

4

. To create an instance from this class, all you  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress257.png)

Testing Your Code

**219**

have to provide is a question. Once you have an instance representing a par-  
ticular survey, you display the survey question with

show_question()

, store a

response using

store_response()

, and show results with

show_results()

.

To show that the

AnonymousSurvey

class works, let's write a program that

uses the class:

*language*

*_survey.py*

from survey import AnonymousSurvey

# Define a question, and make a survey.  
question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"  
language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)

# Show the question, and store responses to the question.  
language_survey.show_question()  
print("Enter 'q' at any time to quit.\\n")  
while True:  
response = input("Language: ")  
if response == 'q':  
break  
language_survey.store_response(response)

# Show the survey results.  
print("\\nThank you to everyone who participated in the survey!")  
language_survey.show_results()

This program defines a question (

"What language did you first learn to

speak?"

) and creates an

AnonymousSurvey

object with that question. The program

calls

show_question()

to display the question and then prompts for responses.

Each response is stored as it is received. When all responses have been entered   
(the user inputs

q

to quit),

show_results()

prints the survey results:

What language did you first learn to speak?  
Enter 'q' at any time to quit.

Language:

**English**

Language:

**Spanish**

Language:

**English**

Language:

**Mandarin**

Language:

**q**

Thank you to everyone who participated in the survey!  
Survey results:  
- English  
- Spanish  
- English  
- Mandarin

This class works for a simple anonymous survey, but say we want to

improve

AnonymousSurvey

and the module it's in,

survey

. We could allow

each user to enter more than one response, we could write a method to   
list only unique responses and to report how many times each response   
was given, or we could even write another class to manage non-anonymous   
surveys.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress258.png)

**220**

Chapter 11

Implementing such changes would risk affecting the current behavior

of the class

AnonymousSurvey

. For example, it's possible that while trying to

allow each user to enter multiple responses, we could accidentally change   
how single responses are handled. To ensure we don't break existing behav-  
ior as we develop this module, we can write tests for the class.

***Testing the AnonymousSurvey Class***

Let's write a test that verifies one aspect of the way

AnonymousSurvey

behaves.

We'll write a test to verify that a single response to the survey question is   
stored properly:

*test_survey.py*

from survey import AnonymousSurvey

1

def test_store_single_response():

"""Test that a single response is stored properly."""  
question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"

2

language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)

language_survey.store_response('English')

3

assert 'English' in language_survey.responses

We start by importing the class we want to test,

AnonymousSurvey

. The

first test function will verify that when we store a response to the survey   
question, the response will end up in the survey's list of responses. A good   
descriptive name for this function is

test_store_single_response()

1

. If this

test fails, we'll know from the function name in the test summary that there   
was a problem storing a single response to the survey.

To test the behavior of a class, we need to make an instance of the

class. We create an instance called

language_survey

2

with the question

"What language did you first learn to speak?"

We store a single response,

English

, using the

store_response()

method. Then we verify that the response

was stored correctly by asserting that

English

is in the list

language_survey

.responses

3

.

By default, running the command

**pytest**

with no arguments will run all

the tests that

pytest

discovers in the current directory. To focus on the tests

in one file, pass the name of the test file you want to run. Here we'll run   
just the one test we wrote for

AnonymousSurvey

:

$

**pytest test_survey.py**

========================= test session starts =========================

*--snip--*

test_survey.py . \[100%\]  
========================== 1 passed in 0.01s ==========================

This is a good start, but a survey is useful only if it generates more than

one response. Let's verify that three responses can be stored correctly. To   
do this, we add another method to

TestAnonymousSurvey

:

from survey import AnonymousSurvey

def test_store_single_response():  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress259.png)

Testing Your Code

**221**

*--snip--*

def test_store_three_responses():  
"""Test that three individual responses are stored properly."""  
question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"  
language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)

1

responses = \['English', 'Spanish', 'Mandarin'\]

for response in responses:  
language_survey.store_response(response)

2

for response in responses:

assert response in language_survey.responses

We call the new function

test_store_three_responses()

. We create a sur-

vey object just like we did in

test_store_single_response()

. We define a list

containing three different responses

1

, and then we call

store_response()

for each of these responses. Once the responses have been stored, we   
write another loop and assert that each response is now in

language_survey

.responses

2

.

When we run the test file again, both tests (for a single response and

for three responses) pass:

$

**pytest test_survey.py**

========================= test session starts =========================

*--snip--*

test_survey.py .. \[100%\]  
========================== 2 passed in 0.01s ==========================

This works perfectly. However, these tests are a bit repetitive, so we'll

use another feature of

pytest

to make them more efficient.

***Using Fixtures***

In *test_survey.py*, we created a new instance of

AnonymousSurvey

in each test

function. This is fine in the short example we're working with, but in a real-  
world project with tens or hundreds of tests, this would be problematic.

In testing, a *fixture* helps set up a test environment. Often, this means

creating a resource that's used by more than one test. We create a fixture in

pytest

by writing a function with the decorator

@pytest.fixture

. A *decorator* is

a directive placed just before a function definition; Python applies this direc-  
tive to the function before it runs, to alter how the function code behaves.   
Don't worry if this sounds complicated; you can start to use decorators from   
third-party packages before learning to write them yourself.

Let's use a fixture to create a single survey instance that can be used in

both test functions in *test_survey.py*:

import pytest

from survey import AnonymousSurvey

1

@pytest.fixture

2

def language_survey():

"""A survey that will be available to all test functions."""  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress260.png)

**222**

Chapter 11

question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"  
language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)  
return language_survey

3

def test_store_single_response(language_survey):

"""Test that a single response is stored properly."""

4

language_survey.store_response('English')

assert 'English' in language_survey.responses

5

def test_store_three_responses(language_survey):

"""Test that three individual responses are stored properly."""

responses = \['English', 'Spanish', 'Mandarin'\]

for response in responses:

6

language_survey.store_response(response)

for response in responses:  
assert response in language_survey.responses

We need to import

pytest

now, because we're using a decorator that's

defined in

pytest

. We apply the

@pytest.fixture

decorator

1

to the new func-

tion

language_survey()

2

. This function builds an

AnonymousSurvey

object and

returns the new survey.

Notice that the definitions of both test functions have changed

3

5

;

each test function now has a parameter called

language_survey

. When

a parameter in a test function matches the name of a function with the

@pytest.fixture

decorator, the fixture will be run automatically and

the return value will be passed to the test function. In this example, the   
function

language_survey()

supplies both

test_store_single_response()

and

test_store_three_responses()

with a

language_survey

instance.

There's no new code in either of the test functions, but notice that two

lines have been removed from each function

4

6

: the line that defined a

question and the line that created an

AnonymousSurvey

object.

When we run the test file again, both tests still pass. These tests would

be particularly useful when trying to expand

AnonymousSurvey

to handle

multiple responses for each person. After modifying the code to accept   
multiple responses, you could run these tests and make sure you haven't   
affected the ability to store a single response or a series of individual   
responses.

The structure above will almost certainly look complicated; it contains

some of the most abstract code you've seen so far. You don't need to use   
fixtures right away; it's better to write tests that have a lot of repetitive code   
than to write no tests at all. Just know that when you've written enough   
tests that the repetition is getting in the way, there's a well-established way   
to deal with the repetition. Also, fixtures in simple examples like this one   
don't really make the code any shorter or simpler to follow. But in projects   
with many tests, or in situations where it takes many lines to build a resource   
that's used in multiple tests, fixtures can drastically improve your test code.

When you want to write a fixture, write a function that generates the

resource that's used by multiple test functions. Add the

@pytest.fixture

![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress261.png)

Testing Your Code

**223**

decorator to the new function, and add the name of this function as a   
parameter for each test function that uses this resource. Your tests will be   
shorter and easier to write and maintain from that point forward.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**11-3. Employee:**

Write a class called

Employee

. The

__init__()

method should

take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these   
as attributes. Write a method called

give_raise()

that adds $5,000 to the

annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.

Write a test file for

Employee

with two test functions,

test_give_default

_raise()

and

test_give_custom_raise()

. Write your tests once without using a

fixture, and make sure they both pass. Then write a fixture so you don't have to   
create a new employee instance in each test function. Run the tests again, and   
make sure both tests still pass.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned to write tests for functions and classes using   
tools in the

pytest

module. You learned to write test functions that verify

specific behaviors your functions and classes should exhibit. You saw how   
fixtures can be used to efficiently create resources that can be used in mul-  
tiple test functions in a test file.

Testing is an important topic that many newer programmers aren't

exposed to. You don't have to write tests for all the simple projects you try   
as a new programmer. But as soon as you start to work on projects that   
involve significant development effort, you should test the critical behaviors   
of your functions and classes. You'll be more confident that new work on   
your project won't break the parts that work, and this will give you the free-  
dom to make improvements to your code. If you accidentally break existing   
functionality, you'll know right away, so you can still fix the problem easily.   
Responding to a failed test that you ran is much easier than responding to a   
bug report from an unhappy user.

Other programmers will respect your projects more if you include some

initial tests. They'll feel more comfortable experimenting with your code   
and be more willing to work with you on projects. If you want to contribute   
to a project that other programmers are working on, you'll be expected to   
show that your code passes existing tests and you'll usually be expected   
to write tests for any new behavior you introduce to the project.

Play around with tests to become familiar with the process of testing

your code. Write tests for the most critical behaviors of your functions and   
classes, but don't aim for full coverage in early projects unless you have a   
specific reason to do so.

**PART II**

**P R O J E C T S**

Congratulations! You now know enough about Python   
to start building interactive and meaningful projects.   
Creating your own projects will teach you new skills   
and solidify your understanding of the concepts intro-  
duced in Part I.

Part II contains three kinds of projects, and you can choose to do any

or all of these projects in whichever order you like. Here's a brief descrip-  
tion of each project to help you decide which to dig into first.

**Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python**

In the Alien Invasion project (**Chapters 12** , **13** , and **14** ), you'll use the   
Pygame package to develop a 2D game. The goal of the game is to shoot   
down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase   
in speed and difficulty. At the end of the project, you'll have learned skills   
that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.

**Data Visualization**

The Data Visualization projects start in **Chapter 15** , where you'll learn to   
generate data and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations   
of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly. **Chapter 16** teaches you to access   
data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to cre-  
ate plots of weather data and a map of global earthquake activity. Finally,   
**Chapter 17** shows you how to write a program to automatically download  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress264.png)

**226**

Part II: Projects

and visualize data. Learning to make visualizations allows you to explore   
the field of data science, which is one of the highest-demand areas of pro-  
gramming today.

**Web Applications**

In the Web Application project (**Chapters 18** , **19** , and **20** ), you'll use the   
Django package to create a simple web application that allows users to keep   
a journal about different topics they've been learning about. Users will cre-  
ate an account with a username and password, enter a topic, and then make   
entries about what they're learning. You'll also deploy your app to a remote   
server so anyone in the world can access it.

After completing this project, you'll be able to start building your own

simple web applications, and you'll be ready to delve into more thorough   
resources on building applications with Django.

**12**

**A S H I P T H A T F I R E S B U L L E T S**

Let's build a game called *Alien Invasion*!

We'll use Pygame, a collection of fun, pow-

erful Python modules that manage graphics,

animation, and even sound, making it easier

for you to build sophisticated games. With Pygame   
handling tasks like drawing images to the screen, you   
can focus on the higher-level logic of game dynamics.

In this chapter, you'll set up Pygame and then create a rocket ship that

moves right and left and fires bullets in response to player input. In the next   
two chapters, you'll create a fleet of aliens to destroy, and then continue to   
refine the game by setting limits on the number of ships you can use and   
adding a scoreboard.

While building this game, you'll also learn how to manage large proj-

ects that span multiple files. We'll refactor a lot of code and manage file   
contents to organize the project and make the code efficient.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress266.png)

**228**

Chapter 12

Making games is an ideal way to have fun while learning a language. It's

deeply satisfying to play a game you wrote, and writing a simple game will   
teach you a lot about how professionals develop games. As you work through   
this chapter, enter and run the code to identify how each code block contrib-  
utes to overall gameplay. Experiment with different values and settings to   
better understand how to refine interactions in your games.

**N O T E**

Alien Invasion*spans a number of different files, so make a new* alien_invasion

*folder on your system. Be sure to save all files for the project to this folder so your*

*import*

*statements will work correctly.*

*Also, if you feel comfortable using version control, you might want to use it*

*for this project. If you haven't used version control before, se[e Appendix D f](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#521)* *or an
overview.*

**Planning Your Project**

When you're building a large project, it's important to prepare a plan before   
you begin to write code. Your plan will keep you focused and make it more   
likely that you'll complete the project.

Let's write a description of the general gameplay. Although the following

description doesn't cover every detail of *Alien Invasion* , it provides a clear idea   
of how to start building the game:

In *Alien Invasion* , the player controls a rocket ship that appears   
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship   
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the   
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky   
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and   
destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet   
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits   
the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player   
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

For the first development phase, we'll make a ship that can move right

and left when the player presses the arrow keys and fire bullets when the   
player presses the spacebar. After setting up this behavior, we can create the   
aliens and refine the gameplay.

**Installing Pygame**

Before you begin coding, install Pygame. We'll do this the same way we   
installed pytest in[Chapter 11: w](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#247)ith pip. If you skipped [Chapter 11](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#247) or need a   
refresher on pip, se[e "Installing pytest with pip](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#248)" o[n page 210.](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#248)

To install Pygame, enter the following command at a terminal prompt:

$

**python -m pip install --user pygame**

If you use a command other than

**python**

to run programs or start a ter-

minal session, such as

**python3**

, make sure you use that command instead.

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**229**

**Starting the Game Project**

We'll begin building the game by creating an empty Pygame window. Later,   
we'll draw the game elements, such as the ship and the aliens, on this win-  
dow. We'll also make our game respond to user input, set the background   
color, and load a ship image.

***Creating a Pygame Window and Responding to User Input***

We'll make an empty Pygame window by creating a class to represent the   
game. In your text editor, create a new file and save it as *alien_invasion.py* ;   
then enter the following:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

import sys

import pygame

class AlienInvasion:  
"""Overall class to manage game assets and behavior."""

def __init__(self):  
"""Initialize the game, and create game resources."""

1

pygame.init()

2

self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1200, 800))

pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Invasion")

def run_game(self):  
"""Start the main loop for the game."""

3

while True:

# Watch for keyboard and mouse events.

4

for event in pygame.event.get():

5

if event.type == pygame.QUIT:

sys.exit()

# Make the most recently drawn screen visible.

6

pygame.display.flip()

if __name__ == '__main__':  
# Make a game instance, and run the game.  
ai = AlienInvasion()  
ai.run_game()

First, we import the

sys

and

pygame

modules. The

pygame

module con-

tains the functionality we need to make a game. We'll use tools in the

sys

module to exit the game when the player quits.

*Alien Invasion* starts as a class called

AlienInvasion

. In the

__init__()

method, the

pygame.init()

function initializes the background settings that

Pygame needs to work properly

1

. Then we call

pygame.display.set_mode()

to create a display window

2

, on which we'll draw all the game's graphical

elements. The argument

(1200, 800)

is a tuple that defines the dimensions

of the game window, which will be 1,200 pixels wide by 800 pixels high.   
(You can adjust these values depending on your display size.) We assign this  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress268.png)

**230**

Chapter 12

display window to the attribute

self.screen

, so it will be available in all meth-

ods in the class.

The object we assigned to

self.screen

is called a surface. A *surface* in

Pygame is a part of the screen where a game element can be displayed. Each   
element in the game, like an alien or a ship, is its own surface. The surface   
returned by

display.set_mode()

represents the entire game window. When we

activate the game's animation loop, this surface will be redrawn on every   
pass through the loop, so it can be updated with any changes triggered by   
user input.

The game is controlled by the

run_game()

method. This method contains

a

while

loop

3

that runs continually. The

while

loop contains an event loop

and code that manages screen updates. An *event* is an action that the user per-  
forms while playing the game, such as pressing a key or moving the mouse. To   
make our program respond to events, we write an *event loop* to *listen* for events   
and perform appropriate tasks depending on the kinds of events that occur.   
The

for

loop

4

nested inside the

while

loop is an event loop.

To access the events that Pygame detects, we'll use the

pygame.event.get()

function. This function returns a list of events that have taken place since   
the last time this function was called. Any keyboard or mouse event will   
cause this

for

loop to run. Inside the loop, we'll write a series of

if

state-

ments to detect and respond to specific events. For example, when the   
player clicks the game window's close button, a

pygame.QUIT

event is detected

and we call

sys.exit()

to exit the game

5

.

The call to

pygame.display.flip()

6

tells Pygame to make the most

recently drawn screen visible. In this case, it simply draws an empty screen   
on each pass through the

while

loop, erasing the old screen so only the new

screen is visible. When we move the game elements around,

pygame.display

.flip()

continually updates the display to show the new positions of game

elements and hide the old ones, creating the illusion of smooth movement.

At the end of the file, we create an instance of the game and then call

run_game()

. We place

run_game()

in an

if

block that only runs if the file is

called directly. When you run this *alien_invasion.py* file, you should see an   
empty Pygame window.

***Controlling the Frame Rate***

Ideally, games should run at the same speed, or *frame rate* , on all systems.   
Controlling the frame rate of a game that can run on multiple systems is   
a complex issue, but Pygame offers a relatively simple way to accomplish   
this goal. We'll make a clock, and ensure the clock ticks once on each pass   
through the main loop. Anytime the loop processes faster than the rate we   
define, Pygame will calculate the correct amount of time to pause so that   
the game runs at a consistent rate.

We'll define the clock in the

__init__()

method:

*alien_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  
"""Initialize the game, and create game resources."""  
pygame.init()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress269.png)

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**231**

self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()

*--snip--*

After initializing

pygame

, we create an instance of the class

Clock

, from

the

pygame.time

module. Then we'll make the clock tick at the end of the

while

loop in

run_game()

:

def run_game(self):  
"""Start the main loop for the game."""  
while True:  

*--snip--*

pygame.display.flip()

self.clock.tick(60)

The

tick()

method takes one argument: the frame rate for the game.

Here I'm using a value of 60, so Pygame will do its best to make the loop   
run exactly 60 times per second.

**N O T E**

*Pygame's clock should help the game run consistently on most systems. If it makes the*

*game run less consistently on your system, you can try different values for the frame
rate. If you can't find a good frame rate on your system, you can leave the clock out
entirely and adjust the game's settings so it runs well on your system.*

***Setting the Background Color***

Pygame creates a black screen by default, but that's boring. Let's set a differ-  
ent background color. We'll do this at the end of the

__init__()

method.

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Invasion")

# Set the background color.

1

self.bg_color = (230, 230, 230)

def run_game(self):  

*--snip--*

for event in pygame.event.get():  
if event.type == pygame.QUIT:  
sys.exit()

# Redraw the screen during each pass through the loop.

2

self.screen.fill(self.bg_color)

# Make the most recently drawn screen visible.  
pygame.display.flip()  
self.clock.tick(60)

Colors in Pygame are specified as RGB colors: a mix of red, green, and

blue. Each color value can range from 0 to 255. The color value

(255, 0, 0)

is red,

(0, 255, 0)

is green, and

(0, 0, 255)

is blue. You can mix different

RGB values to create up to 16 million colors. The color value

(230, 230, 230)

![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress270.png)

**232**

Chapter 12

mixes equal amounts of red, blue, and green, which produces a light gray   
background color. We assign this color to

self.bg_color

1

.

We fill the screen with the background color using the

fill()

method

2

,

which acts on a surface and takes only one argument: a color.

***Creating a Settings Class***

Each time we introduce new functionality into the game, we'll typically   
create some new settings as well. Instead of adding settings throughout the   
code, let's write a module called

settings

that contains a class called

Settings

to store all these values in one place. This approach allows us to work with   
just one

settings

object anytime we need to access an individual setting.

This also makes it easier to modify the game's appearance and behavior as   
our project grows. To modify the game, we'll change the relevant values in   
*settings.py* , which we'll create next, instead of searching for different settings   
throughout the project.

Create a new file named *settings.py* inside your *alien_invasion*folder, and

add this initial

Settings

class:

*settings.py*

class Settings:  
"""A class to store all settings for Alien Invasion."""

def __init__(self):  
"""Initialize the game's settings."""  
# Screen settings  
self.screen_width = 1200  
self.screen_height = 800  
self.bg_color = (230, 230, 230)

To make an instance of

Settings

in the project and use it to access our

settings, we need to modify *alien_invasion.py* as follows:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

*--snip--*

import pygame

from settings import Settings

class AlienInvasion:  
"""Overall class to manage game assets and behavior."""

def __init__(self):  
"""Initialize the game, and create game resources."""  
pygame.init()  
self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()

1

self.settings = Settings()

2

self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode(

(self.settings.screen_width, self.settings.screen_height))

pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Invasion")  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress271.png)

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**233**

def run_game(self):  

*--snip--*

# Redraw the screen during each pass through the loop.

3

self.screen.fill(self.settings.bg_color)

# Make the most recently drawn screen visible.  
pygame.display.flip()  
self.clock.tick(60)

*--snip--*

We import

Settings

into the main program file. Then we create an

instance of

Settings

and assign it to

self.settings

1

, after making the call

to

pygame.init()

. When we create a screen

2

, we use the

screen_width

and

screen_height

attributes of

self.settings

, and then we use

self.settings

to

access the background color when filling the screen

3

as well.

When you run *alien_invasion.py* now you won't yet see any changes,

because all we've done is move the settings we were already using elsewhere.   
Now we're ready to start adding new elements to the screen.

**Adding the Ship Image**

Let's add the ship to our game. To draw the player's ship on the screen,   
we'll load an image and then use the Pygame

blit()

method to draw the

image.

When you're choosing artwork for your games, be sure to pay atten-

tion to licensing. The safest and cheapest way to start is to use freely   
licensed graphics that you can use and modify, from a website lik[e *https://
opengameart.org*.](https://opengameart.org)

You can use almost any type of image file in your game, but it's easiest

when you use a bitmap (*.bmp* ) file because Pygame loads bitmaps by default.   
Although you can configure Pygame to use other file types, some file types   
depend on certain image libraries that must be installed on your computer.   
Most images you'll find are in *.jpg* or *.png* formats, but you can convert them   
to bitmaps using tools like Photoshop, GIMP, and Paint.

Pay particular attention to the background color in your chosen

image. Try to find a file with a transparent or solid background that you   
can replace with any background color, using an image editor. Your games   
will look best if the image's background color matches your game's back-  
ground color. Alternatively, you can match your game's background to the   
image's background.

For*Alien Invasion* , you can use the file *ship.bmp* (Figure 12-1), which is

available in this book's resources at [*https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e*. T](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e)he   
file's background color matches the settings we're using in this project.   
Make a folder called *images* inside your main *alien_invasion* project folder.   
Save the file *ship.bmp* in the *images* folder.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress272.png)

Chapter 12

*Figure 12-1: The ship for*

Alien Invasion

***Creating the Ship Class***

After choosing an image for the ship, we need to display it on the screen. To   
use our ship, we'll create a new

ship

module that will contain the class

Ship

.

This class will manage most of the behavior of the player's ship:

*ship.py*

import pygame

class Ship:  
"""A class to manage the ship."""

def __init__(self, ai_game):  
"""Initialize the ship and set its starting position."""

1

self.screen = ai_game.screen

2

self.screen_rect = ai_game.screen.get_rect()

# Load the ship image and get its rect.

3

self.image = pygame.image.load('images/ship.bmp')

self.rect = self.image.get_rect()

# Start each new ship at the bottom center of the screen.

4

self.rect.midbottom = self.screen_rect.midbottom

5

def blitme(self):

"""Draw the ship at its current location."""  
self.screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)

Pygame is efficient because it lets you treat all game elements like rect-

angles (*rects* ), even if they're not exactly shaped like rectangles. Treating an   
element as a rectangle is efficient because rectangles are simple geometric   
shapes. When Pygame needs to figure out whether two game elements have   
collided, for example, it can do this more quickly if it treats each object as a   
rectangle. This approach usually works well enough that no one playing the  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress273.png)

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**235**

game will notice that we're not working with the exact shape of each game   
element. We'll treat the ship and the screen as rectangles in this class.

We import the

pygame

module before defining the class. The

__init__()

method of

Ship

takes two parameters: the

self

reference and a reference to

the current instance of the

AlienInvasion

class. This will give

Ship

access to

all the game resources defined in

AlienInvasion

. We then assign the screen

to an attribute of

Ship

1

, so we can access it easily in all the methods in this

class. We access the screen's

rect

attribute using the

get_rect()

method and

assign it to

self.screen_rect

2

. Doing so allows us to place the ship in the

correct location on the screen.

To load the image, we call

pygame.image.load()

3

and give it the location

of our ship image. This function returns a surface representing the ship,   
which we assign to

self.image

. When the image is loaded, we call

get_rect()

to

access the ship surface's

rect

attribute so we can later use it to place the ship.

When you're working with a

rect

object, you can use the *x*- and

*y* -coordinates of the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the rectangle, as   
well as the center, to place the object. You can set any of these values to   
establish the current position of the

rect

. When you're centering a game

element, work with the

center

,

centerx

, or

centery

attributes of a

rect

. When

you're working at an edge of the screen, work with the

top

,

bottom

,

left

, or

right

attributes. There are also attributes that combine these properties,

such as

midbottom

,

midtop

,

midleft

, and

midright

. When you're adjusting the

horizontal or vertical placement of the

rect

, you can just use the

x

and

y

attributes, which are the *x* - and *y* -coordinates of its top-left corner. These   
attributes spare you from having to do calculations that game developers   
formerly had to do manually, and you'll use them often.

**N O T E**

*In Pygame, the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the screen, and coordinates*

*increase as you go down and to the right. On a 1200Ã800 screen, the origin is at the
top-left corner, and the bottom-right corner has the coordinates (1200, 800). These
coordinates refer to the game window, not the physical screen.*

We'll position the ship at the bottom center of the screen. To do so,

make the value of

self.rect.midbottom

match the

midbottom

attribute of the

screen's

rect

4

. Pygame uses these

rect

attributes to position the ship image

so it's centered horizontally and aligned with the bottom of the screen.

Finally, we define the

blitme()

method

5

, which draws the image to the

screen at the position specified by

self.rect

.

***Drawing the Ship to the Screen***

Now let's update *alien_invasion.py* so it creates a ship and calls the ship's

blitme()

method:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

*--snip--*

from settings import Settings

from ship import Ship  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress274.png)

**236**

Chapter 12

class AlienInvasion:  
"""Overall class to manage game assets and behavior."""

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Invasion")

1

self.ship = Ship(self)

def run_game(self):  

*--snip--*

# Redraw the screen during each pass through the loop.  
self.screen.fill(self.settings.bg_color)

2

self.ship.blitme()

# Make the most recently drawn screen visible.  
pygame.display.flip()  
self.clock.tick(60)

*--snip--*

We import

Ship

and then make an instance of

Ship

after the screen has

been created

1

. The call to

Ship()

requires one argument: an instance

of

AlienInvasion

. The

self

argument here refers to the current instance of

AlienInvasion

. This is the parameter that gives

Ship

access to the game's

resources, such as the

screen

object. We assign this

Ship

instance to

self.ship

.

After filling the background, we draw the ship on the screen by calling

ship.blitme()

, so the ship appears on top of the background

2

.

When you run *alien_invasion.py* now, you should see an empty game

screen with the rocket ship sitting at the bottom center, as shown in   
Figure 12-2.

*Figure 12-2:*

Alien Invasion

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**237**

**Refactoring: The _check_events() and _update_screen() Methods**

In large projects, you'll often refactor code you've written before adding   
more code. Refactoring simplifies the structure of the code you've already   
written, making it easier to build on. In this section, we'll break the

run_game()

method, which is getting lengthy, into two helper methods. A *helper method*   
does work inside a class but isn't meant to be used by code outside the class.   
In Python, a single leading underscore indicates a helper method.

***The _check_events() Method***

We'll move the code that manages events to a separate method called

_check_events()

. This will simplify

run_game()

and isolate the event manage-

ment loop. Isolating the event loop allows you to manage events separately   
from other aspects of the game, such as updating the screen.

Here's the

AlienInvasion

class with the new

_check_events()

method,

which only affects the code in

run_game()

:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def run_game(self):  
"""Start the main loop for the game."""  
while True:

1

self._check_events()

# Redraw the screen during each pass through the loop.  

*--snip--*

2

def _check_events(self):

"""Respond to keypresses and mouse events."""  

for event in pygame.event.get():

if event.type == pygame.QUIT:  
sys.exit()

We make a new

_check_events()

method

2

and move the lines that check

whether the player has clicked to close the window into this new method.

To call a method from within a class, use dot notation with the variable

self

and the name of the method

1

. We call the method from inside the

while

loop in

run_game()

.

***The _update_screen() Method***

To further simplify

run_game()

, we'll move the code for updating the screen

to a separate method called

_update_screen()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def run_game(self):  
"""Start the main loop for the game."""  
while True:  
self._check_events()  

self._update_screen()

self.clock.tick(60)

def _check_events(self):  

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress276.png)

**238**

Chapter 12

def _update_screen(self):  
"""Update images on the screen, and flip to the new screen."""  

self.screen.fill(self.settings.bg_color)

self.ship.blitme()

pygame.display.flip()

We moved the code that draws the background and the ship and flips

the screen to

_update_screen()

. Now the body of the main loop in

run_game()

is much simpler. It's easy to see that we're looking for new events, updating   
the screen, and ticking the clock on each pass through the loop.

If you've already built a number of games, you'll probably start out by

breaking your code into methods like these. But if you've never tackled a   
project like this, you probably won't know exactly how to structure your   
code at first. This approach gives you an idea of a realistic development pro-  
cess: you start out writing your code as simply as possible, and then refactor   
it as your project becomes more complex.

Now that we've restructured the code to make it easier to add to, we can

work on the dynamic aspects of the game!

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**12-1. Blue Sky:**

Make a Pygame window with a blue background.

**12-2. Game Character:**

Find a bitmap image of a game character you like or

convert an image to a bitmap. Make a class that draws the character at the   
center of the screen, then match the background color of the image to the back-  
ground color of the screen or vice versa.

**Piloting the Ship**

Next, we'll give the player the ability to move the ship right and left. We'll   
write code that responds when the player presses the right or left arrow key.   
We'll focus first on movement to the right, and then we'll apply the same   
principles to control movement to the left. As we add this code, you'll learn   
how to control the movement of images on the screen and respond to user   
input.

***Responding to a Keypress***

Whenever the player presses a key, that keypress is registered in Pygame as   
an event. Each event is picked up by the

pygame.event.get()

method. We need

to specify in our

_check_events()

method what kinds of events we want the

game to check for. Each keypress is registered as a

KEYDOWN

event.

**239**

When Pygame detects a

KEYDOWN

event, we need to check whether the

key that was pressed is one that triggers a certain action. For example, if the   
player presses the right arrow key, we want to increase the ship's

rect.x

value

to move the ship to the right:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_events(self):  
"""Respond to keypresses and mouse events."""  
for event in pygame.event.get():  
if event.type == pygame.QUIT:  
sys.exit()

1

elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:

2

if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:

# Move the ship to the right.

3

self.ship.rect.x += 1

Inside

_check_events()

we add an

elif

block to the event loop, to respond

when Pygame detects a

KEYDOWN

event

1

. We check whether the key pressed,

event.key

, is the right arrow key

2

. The right arrow key is represented by

pygame.K_RIGHT

. If the right arrow key was pressed, we move the ship to the

right by increasing the value of

self.ship.rect.x

by 1

3

.

When you run *alien_invasion.py* now, the ship should move to the right

one pixel every time you press the right arrow key. That's a start, but it's not   
an efficient way to control the ship. Let's improve this control by allowing   
continuous movement.

***Allowing Continuous Movement***

When the player holds down the right arrow key, we want the ship to continue   
moving right until the player releases the key. We'll have the game detect a

pygame.KEYUP

event so we'll know when the right arrow key is released; then

we'll use the

KEYDOWN

and

KEYUP

events together with a flag called

moving_right

to implement continuous motion.

When the

moving_right

flag is

False

, the ship will be motionless. When

the player presses the right arrow key, we'll set the flag to

True

, and when the

player releases the key, we'll set the flag to

False

again.

The

Ship

class controls all attributes of the ship, so we'll give it an attri-

bute called

moving_right

and an

update()

method to check the status of the

moving_right

flag. The

update()

method will change the position of the ship if

the flag is set to

True

. We'll call this method once on each pass through the

while

loop to update the position of the ship.

Here are the changes to

Ship

:

*ship.py*

class Ship:  
"""A class to manage the ship."""

def __init__(self, ai_game):  

*--snip--*

# Start each new ship at the bottom center of the screen.  
self.rect.midbottom = self.screen_rect.midbottom  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress278.png)

**240**

Chapter 12

# Movement flag; start with a ship that's not moving.

1

self.moving_right = False

2

def update(self):

"""Update the ship's position based on the movement flag."""  
if self.moving_right:  
self.rect.x += 1

def blitme(self):  

*--snip--*

We add a

self.moving_right

attribute in the

__init__()

method and set it

to

False

initially

1

. Then we add

update()

, which moves the ship right if the

flag is

True

2

. The

update()

method will be called from outside the class, so

it's not considered a helper method.

Now we need to modify

_check_events()

so that

moving_right

is set to

True

when the right arrow key is pressed and

False

when the key is released:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_events(self):  
"""Respond to keypresses and mouse events."""  
for event in pygame.event.get():  

*--snip--*

elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:  
if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:

1

self.ship.moving_right = True

2

elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:

if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:  
self.ship.moving_right = False

Here, we modify how the game responds when the player presses the

right arrow key: instead of changing the ship's position directly, we merely   
set

moving_right

to

True

1

. Then we add a new

elif

block, which responds to

KEYUP

events

2

. When the player releases the right arrow key (

K_RIGHT

), we

set

moving_right

to

False

.

Next, we modify the

while

loop in

run_game()

so it calls the ship's

update()

method on each pass through the loop:

*alien_invasion.py*

def run_game(self):  
"""Start the main loop for the game."""  
while True:  
self._check_events()  

self.ship.update()

self._update_screen()  
self.clock.tick(60)

The ship's position will be updated after we've checked for keyboard

events and before we update the screen. This allows the ship's position to be   
updated in response to player input and ensures the updated position will   
be used when drawing the ship to the screen.

When you run *alien_invasion.py* and hold down the right arrow key, the

ship should move continuously to the right until you release the key.

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**241**

***Moving Both Left and Right***

Now that the ship can move continuously to the right, adding movement   
to the left is straightforward. Again, we'll modify the

Ship

class and the

_check_events()

method. Here are the relevant changes to

__init__()

and

update()

in

Ship

:

*ship.py*

def __init__(self, ai_game):  

*--snip--*

# Movement flags; start with a ship that's not moving.

self.moving_right = False

self.moving_left = False

def update(self):

"""Update the ship's position based on movement flags."""

if self.moving_right:  
self.rect.x += 1

if self.moving_left:

self.rect.x -= 1

In

__init__()

, we add a

self.moving_left

flag. In

update()

, we use two

separate

if

blocks, rather than an

elif

, to allow the ship's

rect.x

value to be

increased and then decreased when both arrow keys are held down. This   
results in the ship standing still. If we used

elif

for motion to the left, the

right arrow key would always have priority. Using two

if

blocks makes the

movements more accurate when the player might momentarily hold down   
both keys when changing directions.

We have to make two additions to

_check_events()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_events(self):  
"""Respond to keypresses and mouse events."""  
for event in pygame.event.get():  

*--snip--*

elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:  
if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:  
self.ship.moving_right = True

elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:  
self.ship.moving_left = True

elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:  
if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:  
self.ship.moving_right = False

elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:  
self.ship.moving_left = False

If a

KEYDOWN

event occurs for the

K_LEFT

key, we set

moving_left

to

True

. If a

KEYUP

event occurs for the

K_LEFT

key, we set

moving_left

to

False

. We can use

elif

blocks here because each event is connected to only one key. If the player

presses both keys at once, two separate events will be detected.

When you run *alien_invasion.py* now, you should be able to move the

ship continuously to the right and left. If you hold down both keys, the ship   
should stop moving.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress280.png)

**242**

Chapter 12

Next, we'll further refine the ship's movement. Let's adjust the ship's

speed and limit how far the ship can move so it can't disappear off the sides   
of the screen.

***Adjusting the Ship's Speed***

Currently, the ship moves one pixel per cycle through the

while

loop, but we

can take finer control of the ship's speed by adding a

ship_speed

attribute to

the

Settings

class. We'll use this attribute to determine how far to move the

ship on each pass through the loop. Here's the new attribute in *settings.py*:

*settings.py*

class Settings:  
"""A class to store all settings for Alien Invasion."""

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

# Ship settings  
self.ship_speed = 1.5

We set the initial value of

ship_speed

to

1.5

. When the ship moves now,

its position is adjusted by 1.5 pixels (rather than 1 pixel) on each pass   
through the loop.

We're using a float for the speed setting to give us finer control of the

ship's speed when we increase the tempo of the game later on. However,

rect

attributes such as

x

store only integer values, so we need to make some

modifications to

Ship

:

*ship.py*

class Ship:  
"""A class to manage the ship."""

def __init__(self, ai_game):

"""Initialize the ship and set its starting position."""  
self.screen = ai_game.screen

1

self.settings = ai_game.settings

*--snip--*

# Start each new ship at the bottom center of the screen.  
self.rect.midbottom = self.screen_rect.midbottom

# Store a float for the ship's exact horizontal position.

2

self.x = float(self.rect.x)

# Movement flags; start with a ship that's not moving.  
self.moving_right = False  
self.moving_left = False

def update(self):  
"""Update the ship's position based on movement flags."""  

# Update the ship's x value, not the rect.

if self.moving_right:

3

self.x += self.settings.ship_speed  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress281.png)

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**243**

if self.moving_left:

self.x -= self.settings.ship_speed

# Update rect object from self.x.

4

self.rect.x = self.x

def blitme(self):  

*--snip--*

We create a

settings

attribute for

Ship

, so we can use it in

update()

1

.

Because we're adjusting the position of the ship by fractions of a pixel, we   
need to assign the position to a variable that can have a float assigned to it.   
You can use a float to set an attribute of a

rect

, but the

rect

will only keep

the integer portion of that value. To keep track of the ship's position accu-  
rately, we define a new

self.x

2

. We use the

float()

function to convert the

value of

self.rect.x

to a float and assign this value to

self.x

.

Now when we change the ship's position in

update()

, the value of

self.x

is adjusted by the amount stored in

settings.ship_speed

3

. After

self.x

has been updated, we use the new value to update

self.rect.x

, which con-

trols the position of the ship

4

. Only the integer portion of

self.x

will be

assigned to

self.rect.x

, but that's fine for displaying the ship.

Now we can change the value of

ship_speed

, and any value greater than 1

will make the ship move faster. This will help make the ship respond   
quickly enough to shoot down aliens, and it will let us change the tempo   
of the game as the player progresses in gameplay.

***Limiting the Ship's Range***

At this point, the ship will disappear off either edge of the screen if you   
hold down an arrow key long enough. Let's correct this so the ship stops   
moving when it reaches the screen's edge. We do this by modifying the

update()

method in

Ship

:

*ship.py*

def update(self):  
"""Update the ship's position based on movement flags."""  
# Update the ship's x value, not the rect.

1

if self.moving_right and self.rect.right \< self.screen_rect.right:

self.x += self.settings.ship_speed

2

if self.moving_left and self.rect.left \> 0:

self.x -= self.settings.ship_speed

# Update rect object from self.x.  
self.rect.x = self.x

This code checks the position of the ship before changing the value of

self.x

. The code

self.rect.right

returns the *x*-coordinate of the right edge

of the ship's

rect

. If this value is less than the value returned by

self.screen

_rect.right

, the ship hasn't reached the right edge of the screen

1

. The same

goes for the left edge: if the value of the left side of the

rect

is greater than 0,

the ship hasn't reached the left edge of the screen

2

. This ensures the ship

is within these bounds before adjusting the value of

self.x

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress282.png)

**244**

Chapter 12

When you run *alien_invasion.py* now, the ship should stop moving at

either edge of the screen. This is pretty cool; all we've done is add a con-  
ditional test in an

if

statement, but it feels like the ship hits a wall or force

field at either edge of the screen!

***Refactoring _check_events()***

The

_check_events()

method will increase in length as we continue to

develop the game, so let's break

_check_events()

into two separate methods:

one that handles

KEYDOWN

events and another that handles

KEYUP

events:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_events(self):  
"""Respond to keypresses and mouse events."""  
for event in pygame.event.get():  
if event.type == pygame.QUIT:  
sys.exit()  
elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:  

self._check_keydown_events(event)

elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:  

self._check_keyup_events(event)

def _check_keydown_events(self, event):  
"""Respond to keypresses."""

if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:  
self.ship.moving_right = True  
elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:  
self.ship.moving_left = True

def _check_keyup_events(self, event):  
"""Respond to key releases."""

if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:  
self.ship.moving_right = False  
elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:  
self.ship.moving_left = False

We make two new helper methods:

_check_keydown_events()

and

_check

_keyup_events()

. Each needs a

self

parameter and an

event

parameter. The

bodies of these two methods are copied from

_check_events()

, and we've

replaced the old code with calls to the new methods. The

_check_events()

method is simpler now with this cleaner code structure, which will make it   
easier to develop further responses to player input.

***Pressing Q to Quit***

Now that we're responding to keypresses efficiently, we can add another   
way to quit the game. It gets tedious to click the X at the top of the game   
window to end the game every time you test a new feature, so we'll add a   
keyboard shortcut to end the game when the player presses Q:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_keydown_events(self, event):  

*--snip--*

elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress283.png)

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**245**

self.ship.moving_left = True

elif event.key == pygame.K_q:  
sys.exit()

In

_check_keydown_events()

, we add a new block that ends the game when

the player presses Q. Now, when testing, you can press Q to close the game   
instead of using your cursor to close the window.

***Running the Game in Fullscreen Mode***

Pygame has a fullscreen mode that you might like better than running   
the game in a regular window. Some games look better in fullscreen   
mode, and on some systems, the game may perform better overall in   
fullscreen mode.

To run the game in fullscreen mode, make the following changes in

__init__()

:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  
"""Initialize the game, and create game resources."""  
pygame.init()  
self.settings = Settings()

1

self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((0, 0), pygame.FULLSCREEN)

2

self.settings.screen_width = self.screen.get_rect().width

self.settings.screen_height = self.screen.get_rect().height  

pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Invasion")

When creating the screen surface, we pass a size of

(0, 0)

and the

parameter

pygame.FULLSCREEN

1

. This tells Pygame to figure out a window

size that will fill the screen. Because we don't know the width and height of   
the screen ahead of time, we update these settings after the screen is cre-  
ated

2

. We use the

width

and

height

attributes of the screen's

rect

to update

the

settings

object.

If you like how the game looks or behaves in fullscreen mode, keep

these settings. If you liked the game better in its own window, you can   
revert back to the original approach where we set a specific screen size for   
the game.

**N O T E**

*Make sure you can quit by pressing Q before running the game in fullscreen mode;*

*Pygame offers no default way to quit a game while in fullscreen mode.*

**A Quick Recap**

In the next section, we'll add the ability to shoot bullets, which involves add-  
ing a new file called *bullet.py* and making some modifications to some of the   
files we're already using. Right now, we have three files containing a num-  
ber of classes and methods. To be clear about how the project is organized,   
let's review each of these files before adding more functionality.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress284.png)

**246**

Chapter 12

***alien_invasion.py***

The main file, *alien_invasion.py*, contains the

AlienInvasion

class. This class

creates a number of important attributes used throughout the game: the   
settings are assigned to

settings

, the main display surface is assigned to

screen

, and a

ship

instance is created in this file as well. The main loop of

the game, a

while

loop, is also stored in this module. The

while

loop calls

_check_events()

,

ship.update()

, and

_update_screen()

. It also ticks the clock on

each pass through the loop.

The

_check_events()

method detects relevant events, such as keypresses

and releases, and processes each of these types of events through the meth-  
ods

_check_keydown_events()

and

_check_keyup_events()

. For now, these methods

manage the ship's movement. The

AlienInvasion

class also contains

_update

_screen()

, which redraws the screen on each pass through the main loop.

The *alien_invasion.py*file is the only file you need to run when you want

to play*Alien Invasion* . The other files, *settings.py* and *ship.py* , contain code   
that is imported into this file.

***settings.py***

The *settings.py* file contains the

Settings

class. This class only has an

__init__()

method, which initializes attributes controlling the game's appearance and   
the ship's speed.

***ship.py***

The *ship.py* file contains the

Ship

class. The

Ship

class has an

__init__()

method,

an

update()

method to manage the ship's position, and a

blitme()

method to

draw the ship to the screen. The image of the ship is stored in *ship.bmp* , which   
is in the *images* folder.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**12-3. Pygame Documentation:**

We're far enough into the game now that you

might want to look at some of the Pygame documentation. The Pygame home   
page is at

[*https://pygame.org*](https://pygame.org)

, and the home page for the documentation is at

[*https://pygame.org/docs*](https://pygame.org/docs)

[. J](https://pygame.org/docs)ust skim the documentation for now. You won't need

it to complete this project, but it will help if you want to modify

*Alien Invasion*

or

make your own game afterward.

**12-4. Rocket:**

Make a game that begins with a rocket in the center of the screen.

Allow the player to move the rocket up, down, left, or right using the four arrow   
keys. Make sure the rocket never moves beyond any edge of the screen.

**12-5. Keys:**

Make a Pygame file that creates an empty screen. In the event loop,

print the

event.key

attribute whenever a

pygame.KEYDOWN

event is detected. Run

the program and press various keys to see how Pygame responds.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress285.png)

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**247**

**Shooting Bullets**

Now let's add the ability to shoot bullets. We'll write code that fires a bullet,   
which is represented by a small rectangle, when the player presses the space-  
bar. Bullets will then travel straight up the screen until they disappear off   
the top of the screen.

***Adding the Bullet Settings***

At the end of the

__init__()

method, we'll update *settings.py* to include the

values we'll need for a new

Bullet

class:

*settings.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

# Bullet settings

self.bullet_speed = 2.0

self.bullet_width = 3

self.bullet_height = 15

self.bullet_color = (60, 60, 60)

These settings create dark gray bullets with a width of

3

pixels and a

height of

15

pixels. The bullets will travel slightly faster than the ship.

***Creating the Bullet Class***

Now create a *bullet.py*file to store our

Bullet

class. Here's the first part of

*bullet.py*:

*bullet.py*

import pygame  
from pygame.sprite import Sprite

class Bullet(Sprite):  
"""A class to manage bullets fired from the ship."""

def __init__(self, ai_game):  
"""Create a bullet object at the ship's current position."""  
super().__init__()  
self.screen = ai_game.screen  
self.settings = ai_game.settings  
self.color = self.settings.bullet_color

# Create a bullet rect at (0, 0) and then set correct position.

1

self.rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.settings.bullet_width,

self.settings.bullet_height)

2

self.rect.midtop = ai_game.ship.rect.midtop

# Store the bullet's position as a float.

3

self.y = float(self.rect.y)

The

Bullet

class inherits from

Sprite

, which we import from the

pygame

.sprite

module. When you use sprites, you can group related elements in

your game and act on all the grouped elements at once. To create a bullet   
instance,

__init__()

needs the current instance of

AlienInvasion

, and we call  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress286.png)

**248**

Chapter 12

super()

to inherit properly from

Sprite

. We also set attributes for the screen

and settings objects, and for the bullet's color.

Next we create the bullet's

rect

attribute

1

. The bullet isn't based on an

image, so we have to build a

rect

from scratch using the

pygame.Rect()

class.

This class requires the *x* - and *y*-coordinates of the top-left corner of the

rect

, and the width and height of the

rect

. We initialize the

rect

at (0, 0),

but we'll move it to the correct location in the next line, because the bullet's   
position depends on the ship's position. We get the width and height of the   
bullet from the values stored in

self.settings

.

We set the bullet's

midtop

attribute to match the ship's

midtop

attribute

2

.

This will make the bullet emerge from the top of the ship, making it look like   
the bullet is fired from the ship. We use a float for the bullet's *y* -coordinate so   
we can make fine adjustments to the bullet's speed

3

.

Here's the second part of *bullet.py*,

update()

and

draw_bullet()

:

*bullet.py*

def update(self):  
"""Move the bullet up the screen."""  
# Update the exact position of the bullet.

1

self.y -= self.settings.bullet_speed

# Update the rect position.

2

self.rect.y = self.y

def draw_bullet(self):  
"""Draw the bullet to the screen."""

3

pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, self.color, self.rect)

The

update()

method manages the bullet's position. When a bullet is

fired, it moves up the screen, which corresponds to a decreasing *y* -coordinate   
value. To update the position, we subtract the amount stored in

settings

.bullet_speed

from

self.y

1

. We then use the value of

self.y

to set the value

of

self.rect.y

2

.

The

bullet_speed

setting allows us to increase the speed of the bullets

as the game progresses or as needed to refine the game's behavior. Once a   
bullet is fired, we never change the value of its *x* -coordinate, so it will travel   
vertically in a straight line even if the ship moves.

When we want to draw a bullet, we call

draw_bullet()

. The

draw.rect()

function fills the part of the screen defined by the bullet's

rect

with the

color stored in

self.color

3

.

***Storing Bullets in a Group***

Now that we have a

Bullet

class and the necessary settings defined, we can

write code to fire a bullet each time the player presses the spacebar. We'll   
create a group in

AlienInvasion

to store all the active bullets so we can man-

age the bullets that have already been fired. This group will be an instance   
of the

pygame.sprite.Group

class, which behaves like a list with some extra

functionality that's helpful when building games. We'll use this group   
to draw bullets to the screen on each pass through the main loop and to   
update each bullet's position.

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**249**

First, we'll import the new

Bullet

class:

*alien_invasion.py*

*--snip--*

from ship import Ship

from bullet import Bullet

Next we'll create the group that holds the bullets in

__init__()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

self.ship = Ship(self)  

self.bullets = pygame.sprite.Group()

Then we need to update the position of the bullets on each pass through

the

while

loop:

*alien_invasion.py*

def run_game(self):  
"""Start the main loop for the game."""  
while True:  
self._check_events()  
self.ship.update()  

self.bullets.update()

self._update_screen()  
self.clock.tick(60)

When you call

update()

on a group, the group automatically calls

update()

for each sprite in the group. The line

self.bullets.update()

calls

bullet.update()

for each bullet we place in the group

bullets

.

***Firing Bullets***

In

AlienInvasion

, we need to modify

_check_keydown_events()

to fire a bullet

when the player presses the spacebar. We don't need to change

_check_keyup

_events()

because nothing happens when the spacebar is released. We also

need to modify

_update_screen()

to make sure each bullet is drawn to the

screen before we call

flip()

.

There will be a bit of work to do when we fire a bullet, so let's write a

new method,

_fire_bullet()

, to handle this work:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_keydown_events(self, event):  

*--snip--*

elif event.key == pygame.K_q:  
sys.exit()

1

elif event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:

self._fire_bullet()

def _check_keyup_events(self, event):  

*--snip--*

def _fire_bullet(self):  
"""Create a new bullet and add it to the bullets group."""

2

new_bullet = Bullet(self)

3

self.bullets.add(new_bullet)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress288.png)

**250**

Chapter 12

def _update_screen(self):  
"""Update images on the screen, and flip to the new screen."""  
self.screen.fill(self.settings.bg_color)

4

for bullet in self.bullets.sprites():

bullet.draw_bullet()

self.ship.blitme()

pygame.display.flip()

*--snip--*

We call

_fire_bullet()

when the spacebar is pressed

1

. In

_fire_bullet()

,

we make an instance of

Bullet

and call it

new_bullet

2

. We then add it to

the group

bullets

using the

add()

method

3

. The

add()

method is similar to

append()

, but it's written specifically for Pygame groups.

The

bullets.sprites()

method returns a list of all sprites in the group

bullets

. To draw all fired bullets to the screen, we loop through the sprites

in

bullets

and call

draw_bullet()

on each one

4

. We place this loop before

the line that draws the ship, so the bullets don't start out on top of the ship.

When you run *alien_invasion.py* now, you should be able to move the ship

right and left and fire as many bullets as you want. The bullets travel up the   
screen and disappear when they reach the top, as shown in Figure 12-3. You   
can alter the size, color, and speed of the bullets in *settings.py*.

*Figure 12-3: The ship after firing a series of bullets*

***Deleting Old Bullets***

At the moment, the bullets disappear when they reach the top, but only   
because Pygame can't draw them above the top of the screen. The bullets   
actually continue to exist; their *y* -coordinate values just grow increasingly   
negative. This is a problem because they continue to consume memory and   
processing power.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress289.png)

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**251**

We need to get rid of these old bullets, or the game will slow down from

doing so much unnecessary work. To do this, we need to detect when the

bottom

value of a bullet's

rect

has a value of 0, which indicates the bullet has

passed off the top of the screen:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def run_game(self):  
"""Start the main loop for the game."""  
while True:  
self._check_events()  
self.ship.update()  
self.bullets.update()

# Get rid of bullets that have disappeared.

1

for bullet in self.bullets.copy():

2

if bullet.rect.bottom \<= 0:

3

self.bullets.remove(bullet)

4

print(len(self.bullets))

self._update_screen()  
self.clock.tick(60)

When you use a

for

loop with a list (or a group in Pygame), Python

expects that the list will stay the same length as long as the loop is running.   
That means you can't remove items from a list or group within a

for

loop,

so we have to loop over a copy of the group. We use the

copy()

method to set

up the

for

loop

1

, which leaves us free to modify the original

bullets

group

inside the loop. We check each bullet to see whether it has disappeared off   
the top of the screen

2

. If it has, we remove it from

bullets

3

. We insert a

print()

call to show how many bullets currently exist in the game and verify

they're being deleted when they reach the top of the screen

4

.

If this code works correctly, we can watch the terminal output while fir-

ing bullets and see that the number of bullets decreases to zero after each   
series of bullets has cleared the top of the screen. After you run the game   
and verify that bullets are being deleted properly, remove the

print()

call. If

you leave it in, the game will slow down significantly because it takes more   
time to write output to the terminal than it does to draw graphics to the   
game window.

***Limiting the Number of Bullets***

Many shooting games limit the number of bullets a player can have on the   
screen at one time; doing so encourages players to shoot accurately. We'll   
do the same in *Alien Invasion*.

First, store the number of bullets allowed in *settings.py*:

*settings.py*

# Bullet settings  

*--snip--*

self.bullet_color = (60, 60, 60)  

self.bullets_allowed = 3  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress290.png)

**252**

Chapter 12

This limits the player to three bullets at a time. We'll use this setting in

AlienInvasion

to check how many bullets exist before creating a new bullet

in

_fire_bullet()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _fire_bullet(self):  
"""Create a new bullet and add it to the bullets group."""  

if len(self.bullets) \< self.settings.bullets_allowed:

new_bullet = Bullet(self)  
self.bullets.add(new_bullet)

When the player presses the spacebar, we check the length of

bullets

.

If

len(self.bullets)

is less than three, we create a new bullet. But if three

bullets are already active, nothing happens when the spacebar is pressed.   
When you run the game now, you should only be able to fire bullets in   
groups of three.

***Creating the _update_bullets() Method***

We want to keep the

AlienInvasion

class reasonably well organized, so now

that we've written and checked the bullet management code, we can move   
it to a separate method. We'll create a new method called

_update_bullets()

and add it just before

_update_screen()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_bullets(self):  
"""Update position of bullets and get rid of old bullets."""  
# Update bullet positions.

self.bullets.update()

# Get rid of bullets that have disappeared.  
for bullet in self.bullets.copy():  
if bullet.rect.bottom \<= 0:  
self.bullets.remove(bullet)

The code for

_update_bullets()

is cut and pasted from

run_game()

; all

we've done here is clarify the comments.

The

while

loop in

run_game()

looks simple again:

*alien_invasion.py*

while True:  
self._check_events()  
self.ship.update()  

self._update_bullets()

self._update_screen()  
self.clock.tick(60)

Now our main loop contains only minimal code, so we can quickly read

the method names and understand what's happening in the game. The   
main loop checks for player input, and then updates the position of the   
ship and any bullets that have been fired. We then use the updated posi-  
tions to draw a new screen and tick the clock at the end of each pass   
through the loop.

A Ship That Fires Bullets

**253**

Run *alien_invasion.py* one more time, and make sure you can still fire

bullets without errors.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**12-6. Sideways Shooter:**

Write a game that places a ship on the left side of the

screen and allows the player to move the ship up and down. Make the ship fire   
a bullet that travels right across the screen when the player presses the space-  
bar. Make sure bullets are deleted once they disappear off the screen.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned to make a plan for a game and learned the   
basic structure of a game written in Pygame. You learned to set a back-  
ground color and store settings in a separate class where you can adjust   
them more easily. You saw how to draw an image to the screen and give the   
player control over the movement of game elements. You created elements   
that move on their own, like bullets flying up a screen, and you deleted   
objects that are no longer needed. You also learned to refactor code in a   
project on a regular basis to facilitate ongoing development.

In [Chapter 13, w](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#293)e'll add aliens to*Alien Invasion*. By the end of the

chapter, you'll be able to shoot down aliens, hopefully before they reach   
your ship!

**13**

**A L I E N S !**

In this chapter, we'll add aliens to *Alien*

*Invasion*. We'll add one alien near the top

of the screen and then generate a whole fleet

of aliens. We'll make the fleet advance sideways

and down, and we'll get rid of any aliens hit by a bullet.   
Finally, we'll limit the number of ships a player has and   
end the game when the player runs out of ships.

As you work through this chapter, you'll learn more about Pygame

and about managing a large project. You'll also learn to detect collisions   
between game objects, like bullets and aliens. Detecting collisions helps you   
define interactions between elements in your games. For example, you can   
confine a character inside the walls of a maze or pass a ball between two   
characters. We'll continue to work from a plan that we revisit occasionally   
to maintain the focus of our code-writing sessions.

Before we start writing new code to add a fleet of aliens to the screen,

let's look at the project and update our plan.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress294.png)

**256**

Chapter 13

**Reviewing the Project**

When you're beginning a new phase of development on a large project,   
it's always a good idea to revisit your plan and clarify what you want to   
accomplish with the code you're about to write. In this chapter, we'll do   
the following:

â¢

Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen, with appropriate   
spacing around it.

â¢

Fill the upper portion of the screen with as many aliens as we can fit   
horizontally. We'll then create additional rows of aliens until we have a   
full fleet.

â¢

Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot   
down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the   
entire fleet is shot down, we'll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the   
ship or the ground, we'll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.

â¢

Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when   
the player has used up the allotted number of ships.

We'll refine this plan as we implement features, but this is specific

enough to start writing code.

You should also review your existing code when you begin working on a

new series of features in a project. Because each new phase typically makes   
a project more complex, it's best to clean up any cluttered or inefficient   
code. We've been refactoring as we go, so there isn't any code that we need   
to refactor at this point.

**Creating the First Alien**

Placing one alien on the screen is like placing a ship on the screen. Each   
alien's behavior is controlled by a class called

Alien

, which we'll structure

like the

Ship

class. We'll continue using bitmap images for simplicity. You

can find your own image for an alien or use the one shown in Figure 13-1,   
which is available in the book's resources a[t *https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e*](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e).   
This image has a gray background, which matches the screen's background   
color. Make sure you save the image file you choose in the *images* folder.

*Figure 13-1: The alien we'll use*

*to build the fleet*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress295.png)

Aliens!

**257**

***Creating the Alien Class***

Now we'll write the

Alien

class and save it as *alien.py*:

*alien.py*

import pygame  
from pygame.sprite import Sprite

class Alien(Sprite):  
"""A class to represent a single alien in the fleet."""

def __init__(self, ai_game):  
"""Initialize the alien and set its starting position."""  
super().__init__()  
self.screen = ai_game.screen

# Load the alien image and set its rect attribute.  
self.image = pygame.image.load('images/alien.bmp')  
self.rect = self.image.get_rect()

# Start each new alien near the top left of the screen.

1

self.rect.x = self.rect.width

self.rect.y = self.rect.height

# Store the alien's exact horizontal position.

2

self.x = float(self.rect.x)

Most of this class is like the

Ship

class, except for the alien's placement on

the screen. We initially place each alien near the top-left corner of the screen;   
we add a space to the left of it that's equal to the alien's width and a space   
above it equal to its height

1

, so it's easy to see. We're mainly concerned with

the aliens' horizontal speed, so we'll track the horizontal position of each   
alien precisely

2

.

This

Alien

class doesn't need a method for drawing it to the screen;

instead, we'll use a Pygame group method that automatically draws all the   
elements of a group to the screen.

***Creating an Instance of the Alien***

We want to create an instance of

Alien

so we can see the first alien on the

screen. Because it's part of our setup work, we'll add the code for this   
instance at the end of the

__init__()

method in

AlienInvasion

. Eventually,

we'll create an entire fleet of aliens, which will be quite a bit of work, so we'll   
make a new helper method called

_create_fleet()

.

The order of methods in a class doesn't matter, as long as there's some

consistency to how they're placed. I'll place

_create_fleet()

just before the

_update_screen()

method, but anywhere in

AlienInvasion

will work. First, we'll

import the

Alien

class.

Here are the updated

import

statements for *alien_invasion.py*:

*alien_invasion.py*

*--snip--*

from bullet import Bullet

from alien import Alien  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress296.png)

**258**

Chapter 13

And here's the updated

__init__()

method:

*alien_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

self.ship = Ship(self)  
self.bullets = pygame.sprite.Group()

self.aliens = pygame.sprite.Group()

self._create_fleet()

We create a group to hold the fleet of aliens, and we call

_create_fleet()

,

which we're about to write.

Here's the new

_create_fleet()

method:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _create_fleet(self):  
"""Create the fleet of aliens."""  
# Make an alien.  
alien = Alien(self)  
self.aliens.add(alien)

In this method, we're creating one instance of

Alien

and then adding it

to the group that will hold the fleet. The alien will be placed in the default   
upper-left area of the screen.

To make the alien appear, we need to call the group's

draw()

method in

_update_screen()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_screen(self):  

*--snip--*

self.ship.blitme()  

self.aliens.draw(self.screen)

pygame.display.flip()

When you call

draw()

on a group, Pygame draws each element in the

group at the position defined by its

rect

attribute. The

draw()

method

requires one argument: a surface on which to draw the elements from the   
group. Figure 13-2 shows the first alien on the screen.

*Figure 13-2: The first alien appears.*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress297.png)

Aliens!

**259**

Now that the first alien appears correctly, we'll write the code to draw

an entire fleet.

**Building the Alien Fleet**

To draw a fleet, we need to figure out how to fill the upper portion of the   
screen with aliens, without overcrowding the game window. There are a num-  
ber of ways to accomplish this goal. We'll approach it by adding aliens across   
the top of the screen, until there's no space left for a new alien. Then we'll   
repeat this process, as long as we have enough vertical space to add a new row.

***Creating a Row of Aliens***

Now we're ready to generate a full row of aliens. To make a full row, we'll   
first make a single alien so we have access to the alien's width. We'll place   
an alien on the left side of the screen and then keep adding aliens until we   
run out of space:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _create_fleet(self):  
"""Create the fleet of aliens."""

# Create an alien and keep adding aliens until there's no room left.  
# Spacing between aliens is one alien width.

alien = Alien(self)

alien_width = alien.rect.width

1

current_x = alien_width

2

while current_x \< (self.settings.screen_width - 2 \* alien_width):

3

new_alien = Alien(self)

4

new_alien.x = current_x

new_alien.rect.x = current_x  
self.aliens.add(new_alien)

5

current_x += 2 \* alien_width

We get the alien's width from the first alien we created, and then define

a variable called

current_x

1

. This refers to the horizontal position of the

next alien we intend to place on the screen. We initially set this to one alien   
width, to offset the first alien in the fleet from the left edge of the screen.

Next, we begin the

while

loop

2

; we're going to keep adding aliens

*while* there's enough room to place one. To determine whether there's room   
to place another alien, we'll compare

current_x

to some maximum value. A

first attempt at defining this loop might look like this:

while current_x \< self.settings.screen_width:

This seems like it might work, but it would place the final alien in the

row at the far-right edge of the screen. So we add a little margin on the   
right side of the screen. As long as there's at least two alien widths' worth   
of space at the right edge of the screen, we enter the loop and add another   
alien to the fleet.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress298.png)

**260**

Chapter 13

Whenever there's enough horizontal space to continue the loop, we

want to do two things: create an alien at the correct position, and define   
the horizontal position of the next alien in the row. We create an alien and   
assign it to

new_alien

3

. Then we set the precise horizontal position to the

current value of

current_x

4

. We also position the alien's

rect

at this same

*x*-value, and add the new alien to the group

self.aliens

.

Finally, we increment the value of

current_x

5

. We add two alien widths

to the horizontal position, to move past the alien we just added and to leave   
some space between the aliens as well. Python will re-evaluate the condition   
at the start of the

while

loop and decide if there's room for another alien.

When there's no room left, the loop will end, and we should have a full row   
of aliens.

When you run *Alien Invasion* now, you should see the first row of aliens

appear, as in Figure 13-3.

*Figure 13-3: The first row of aliens*

**N O T E**

*It's not always obvious exactly how to construct a loop like the one shown in this sec-*

*tion. One nice thing about programming is that your initial ideas for how to approach
a problem like this don't have to be correct. It's perfectly reasonable to start a loop like
this with the aliens positioned too far to the right, and then modify the loop until you
have an appropriate amount of space on the screen.*

***Refactoring _create_fleet()***

If the code we've written so far was all we needed to create a fleet, we'd   
probably leave

_create_fleet()

as is. But we have more work to do, so let's

clean up the method a bit. We'll add a new helper method,

_create_alien()

,

and call it from

_create_fleet()

:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _create_fleet(self):  

*--snip--*

while current_x \< (self.settings.screen_width - 2 \* alien_width):

self._create_alien(current_x)  
current_x += 2 \* alien_width  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress299.png)

Aliens!

**261**

1

def _create_alien(self, x_position):

"""Create an alien and place it in the row."""

new_alien = Alien(self)

new_alien.x = x_position  
new_alien.rect.x = x_position

self.aliens.add(new_alien)

The method

_create_alien()

requires one parameter in addition to

self

:

the *x*-value that specifies where the alien should be placed

1

. The code

in the body of

_create_alien()

is the same code that was in

_create_fleet()

,

except we use the parameter name

x_position

in place of

current_x

. This

refactoring will make it easier to add new rows and create an entire fleet.

***Adding Rows***

To finish the fleet, we'll keep adding more rows until we run out of room.   
We'll use a nested loop---we'll wrap another

while

loop around the current

one. The inner loop will place aliens horizontally in a row by focusing on   
the aliens' *x* -values. The outer loop will place aliens vertically by focusing   
on the *y* -values. We'll stop adding rows when we get near the bottom of the   
screen, leaving enough space for the ship and some room to start firing at   
the aliens.

Here's how to nest the two

while

loops in

_create_fleet()

:

def _create_fleet(self):  
"""Create the fleet of aliens."""  
# Create an alien and keep adding aliens until there's no room left.

# Spacing between aliens is one alien width and one alien height.

alien = Alien(self)

1

alien_width, alien_height = alien.rect.size

2

current_x, current_y = alien_width, alien_height

3

while current_y \< (self.settings.screen_height - 3 \* alien_height):

while current_x \< (self.settings.screen_width - 2 \* alien_width):

4

self._create_alien(current_x, current_y)

current_x += 2 \* alien_width

5

# Finished a row; reset x value, and increment y value.

current_x = alien_width  
current_y += 2 \* alien_height

We'll need to know the alien's height in order to place rows, so we grab

the alien's width and height using the

size

attribute of an alien

rect

1

. A

rect

's

size

attribute is a tuple containing its width and height.

Next, we set the initial *x* - and *y*-values for the placement of the first alien

in the fleet

2

. We place it one alien width in from the left and one alien

height down from the top. Then we define the

while

loop that controls how

many rows are placed onto the screen

3

. As long as the *y*-value for the next

row is less than the screen height, minus three alien heights, we'll keep   
adding rows. (If this doesn't leave the right amount of space, we can   
adjust it later.)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress300.png)

**262**

Chapter 13

We call

_create_alien()

, and pass it the *y* -value as well as its *x*-position

4

.

We'll modify

_create_alien()

in a moment.

Notice the indentation of the last two lines of code

5

. They're inside the

outer

while

loop, but outside the inner

while

loop. This block runs after the

inner loop is finished; it runs once after each row is created. After each   
row has been added, we reset the value of

current_x

so the first alien in the

next row will be placed at the same position as the first alien in the previous   
rows. Then we add two alien heights to the current value of

current_y

, so the

next row will be placed further down the screen. Indentation is really impor-  
tant here; if you don't see the correct fleet when you run *alien_invasion.py*   
at the end of this section, check the indentation of all the lines in these   
nested loops.

We need to modify

_create_alien()

to set the vertical position of the

alien correctly:

def _create_alien(self, x_position, y_position):  
"""Create an alien and place it in the fleet."""

new_alien = Alien(self)  
new_alien.x = x_position  
new_alien.rect.x = x_position

new_alien.rect.y = y_position

self.aliens.add(new_alien)

We modify the definition of the method to accept the *y*-value for the

new alien, and we set the vertical position of the

rect

in the body of the

method.

When you run the game now, you should see a full fleet of aliens, as

shown in Figure 13-4.

*Figure 13-4: The full fleet appears.*

In the next section, we'll make the fleet move!  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress301.png)

Aliens!

**263**

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**13-1. Stars:**

Find an image of a star. Make a grid of stars appear on the screen.

**13-2. Better Stars:**

You can make a more realistic star pattern by introducing

randomness when you place each star. Recall fro[m Chapter 9 t](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#195)hat you can get   
a random number like this:

from random import randint  
random_number = randint(-10, 10)

This code returns a random integer between â10 and 10. Using your code

in Exercise 13-1, adjust each star's position by a random amount.

**Making the Fleet Move**

Now let's make the fleet of aliens move to the right across the screen until   
it hits the edge, and then make it drop a set amount and move in the other   
direction. We'll continue this movement until all aliens have been shot   
down, one collides with the ship, or one reaches the bottom of the screen.   
Let's begin by making the fleet move to the right.

***Moving the Aliens Right***

To move the aliens, we'll use an

update()

method in *alien.py*, which we'll

call for each alien in the group of aliens. First, add a setting to control the   
speed of each alien:

*settings.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

# Alien settings  
self.alien_speed = 1.0

Then use this setting to implement

update()

in *alien.py*:

*alien.py*

def __init__(self, ai_game):  
"""Initialize the alien and set its starting position."""  
super().__init__()  
self.screen = ai_game.screen

self.settings = ai_game.settings  

*--snip--*

def update(self):  
"""Move the alien to the right."""

1

self.x += self.settings.alien_speed

2

self.rect.x = self.x

We create a

settings

parameter in

__init__()

so we can access the alien's

speed in

update()

. Each time we update an alien's position, we move it to the  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress302.png)

**264**

Chapter 13

right by the amount stored in

alien_speed

. We track the alien's exact position

with the

self.x

attribute, which can hold float values

1

. We then use the

value of

self.x

to update the position of the alien's

rect

2

.

In the main

while

loop, we already have calls to update the ship and bul-

let positions. Now we'll add a call to update the position of each alien as well:

*alien_invasion.py*

while True:  
self._check_events()  
self.ship.update()  
self._update_bullets()

self._update_aliens()

self._update_screen()  
self.clock.tick(60)

We're about to write some code to manage the movement of the fleet,

so we create a new method called

_update_aliens()

. We update the aliens'

positions after the bullets have been updated, because we'll soon be check-  
ing to see whether any bullets hit any aliens.

Where you place this method in the module is not critical. But to keep the

code organized, I'll place it just after

_update_bullets()

to match the order of

method calls in the

while

loop. Here's the first version of

_update_aliens()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_aliens(self):  
"""Update the positions of all aliens in the fleet."""  
self.aliens.update()

We use the

update()

method on the

aliens

group, which calls each

alien's

update()

method. When you run *Alien Invasion* now, you should see

the fleet move right and disappear off the side of the screen.

***Creating Settings for Fleet Direction***

Now we'll create the settings that will make the fleet move down the screen   
and to the left when it hits the right edge of the screen. Here's how to   
implement this behavior:

*settings.py*

# Alien settings

self.alien_speed = 1.0

self.fleet_drop_speed = 10  
# fleet_direction of 1 represents right; -1 represents left.  
self.fleet_direction = 1

The setting

fleet_drop_speed

controls how quickly the fleet drops down

the screen each time an alien reaches either edge. It's helpful to separate   
this speed from the aliens' horizontal speed so you can adjust the two   
speeds independently.

To implement the setting

fleet_direction

, we could use a text value such

as

'left'

or

'right'

, but we'd end up with

if

-

elif

statements testing for the

fleet direction. Instead, because we only have two directions to deal with,   
let's use the values 1 and â1 and switch between them each time the fleet  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress303.png)

Aliens!

**265**

changes direction. (Using numbers also makes sense because moving right   
involves adding to each alien's *x* -coordinate value, and moving left involves   
subtracting from each alien's *x*-coordinate value.)

***Checking Whether an Alien Has Hit the Edge***

We need a method to check whether an alien is at either edge, and we need   
to modify

update()

to allow each alien to move in the appropriate direction.

This code is part of the

Alien

class:

*alien.py*

def check_edges(self):  
"""Return True if alien is at edge of screen."""  
screen_rect = self.screen.get_rect()

1

return (self.rect.right \>= screen_rect.right) or (self.rect.left \<= 0)

def update(self):

"""Move the alien right or left."""

2

self.x += self.settings.alien_speed \* self.settings.fleet_direction

self.rect.x = self.x

We can call the new method

check_edges()

on any alien to see whether

it's at the left or right edge. The alien is at the right edge if the

right

attri-

bute of its

rect

is greater than or equal to the

right

attribute of the screen's

rect

. It's at the left edge if its

left

value is less than or equal to 0

1

. Rather

than put this conditional test in an

if

block, we put the test directly in the

return

statement. This method will return

True

if the alien is at the right or

left edge, and

False

if it is not at either edge.

We modify the method

update()

to allow motion to the left or right

by multiplying the alien's speed by the value of

fleet_direction

2

. If

fleet

_direction

is 1, the value of

alien_speed

will be added to the alien's current

position, moving the alien to the right; if

fleet_direction

is â1, the value will

be subtracted from the alien's position, moving the alien to the left.

***Dropping the Fleet and Changing Direction***

When an alien reaches the edge, the entire fleet needs to drop down and   
change direction. Therefore, we need to add some code to

AlienInvasion

because that's where we'll check whether any aliens are at the left or right   
edge. We'll make this happen by writing the methods

_check_fleet_edges()

and

_change_fleet_direction()

, and then modifying

_update_aliens()

. I'll put

these new methods after

_create_alien()

, but again, the placement of these

methods in the class isn't critical.

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_fleet_edges(self):  
"""Respond appropriately if any aliens have reached an edge."""

1

for alien in self.aliens.sprites():

if alien.check_edges():

2

self._change_fleet_direction()

break

def _change_fleet_direction(self):  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress304.png)

**266**

Chapter 13

"""Drop the entire fleet and change the fleet's direction."""  
for alien in self.aliens.sprites():

3

alien.rect.y += self.settings.fleet_drop_speed

self.settings.fleet_direction \*= -1

In

_check_fleet_edges()

, we loop through the fleet and call

check_edges()

on

each alien

1

. If

check_edges()

returns

True

, we know an alien is at an edge and

the whole fleet needs to change direction; so we call

_change_fleet_direction()

and break out of the loop

2

. In

_change_fleet_direction()

, we loop through

all the aliens and drop each one using the setting

fleet_drop_speed

3

; then

we change the value of

fleet_direction

by multiplying its current value by â1.

The line that changes the fleet's direction isn't part of the

for

loop. We want to

change each alien's vertical position, but we only want to change the direction   
of the fleet once.

Here are the changes to

_update_aliens()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_aliens(self):

"""Check if the fleet is at an edge, then update positions."""  
self._check_fleet_edges()  

self.aliens.update()

We've modified the method by calling

_check_fleet_edges()

before

updating each alien's position.

When you run the game now, the fleet should move back and forth

between the edges of the screen and drop down every time it hits an edge.   
Now we can start shooting down aliens and watch for any aliens that hit the   
ship or reach the bottom of the screen.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**13-3. Raindrops:**

Find an image of a raindrop and create a grid of raindrops.

Make the raindrops fall toward the bottom of the screen until they disappear.

**13-4. Steady Rain:**

Modify your code in Exercise 13-3 so when a row of rain-

drops disappears off the bottom of the screen, a new row appears at the top of   
the screen and begins to fall.

**Shooting Aliens**

We've built our ship and a fleet of aliens, but when the bullets reach the   
aliens, they simply pass through because we aren't checking for collisions. In   
game programming, *collisions* happen when game elements overlap. To make   
the bullets shoot down aliens, we'll use the function

sprite.groupcollide()

to

look for collisions between members of two groups.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress305.png)

Aliens!

**267**

***Detecting Bullet Collisions***

We want to know right away when a bullet hits an alien so we can make an   
alien disappear as soon as it's hit. To do this, we'll look for collisions imme-  
diately after updating the position of all the bullets.

The

sprite.groupcollide()

function compares the

rect

s of each element in

one group with the

rect

s of each element in another group. In this case, it com-

pares each bullet's

rect

with each alien's

rect

and returns a dictionary contain-

ing the bullets and aliens that have collided. Each key in the dictionary will be   
a bullet, and the corresponding value will be the alien that was hit. (We'll also   
use this dictionary when we implement a scoring system in [Chapter 14.)](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#315)

Add the following code to the end of

_update_bullets()

to check for colli-

sions between bullets and aliens:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_bullets(self):  
"""Update position of bullets and get rid of old bullets."""  

*--snip--*

# Check for any bullets that have hit aliens.  
# If so, get rid of the bullet and the alien.  
collisions = pygame.sprite.groupcollide(  
self.bullets, self.aliens, True, True)

The new code we added compares the positions of all the bullets in

self.bullets

and all the aliens in

self.aliens

, and identifies any that overlap.

Whenever the

rect

s of a bullet and alien overlap,

groupcollide()

adds a key-

value pair to the dictionary it returns. The two

True

arguments tell Pygame

to delete the bullets and aliens that have collided. (To make a high-powered   
bullet that can travel to the top of the screen, destroying every alien in its   
path, you could set the first Boolean argument to

False

and keep the second

Boolean argument set to

True

. The aliens hit would disappear, but all bullets

would stay active until they disappeared off the top of the screen.)

When you run *Alien Invasion* now, aliens you hit should disappear.

Figure 13-5 shows a fleet that has been partially shot down.

*Figure 13-5: We can shoot aliens!*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress306.png)

**268**

Chapter 13

***Making Larger Bullets for Testing***

You can test many features of *Alien Invasion* simply by running the game,   
but some features are tedious to test in the normal version of the game. For   
example, it's a lot of work to shoot down every alien on the screen multiple   
times to test whether your code responds to an empty fleet correctly.

To test particular features, you can change certain game settings to

focus on a particular area. For example, you might shrink the screen so   
there are fewer aliens to shoot down or increase the bullet speed and give   
yourself lots of bullets at once.

My favorite change for testing *Alien Invasion* is to use really wide bul-

lets that remain active even after they've hit an alien (see Figure 13-6). Try   
setting

bullet_width

to 300, or even 3,000, to see how quickly you can shoot

down the fleet!

*Figure 13-6: Extra-powerful bullets make some aspects of the game*

*easier to test.*

Changes like these will help you test the game more efficiently and pos-

sibly spark ideas for giving players bonus powers. Just remember to restore   
the settings to normal when you're finished testing a feature.

***Repopulating the Fleet***

One key feature of *Alien Invasion* is that the aliens are relentless: every time   
the fleet is destroyed, a new fleet should appear.

To make a new fleet of aliens appear after a fleet has been destroyed,

we first check whether the

aliens

group is empty. If it is, we make a call

to

_create_fleet()

. We'll perform this check at the end of

_update_bullets()

,

because that's where individual aliens are destroyed.

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _update_bullets(self):  

*--snip--*

1

if not self.aliens:  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress307.png)

Aliens!

**269**

# Destroy existing bullets and create new fleet.

2

self.bullets.empty()

self._create_fleet()

We check whether the

aliens

group is empty

1

. An empty group evaluates

to

False

, so this is a simple way to check whether the group is empty. If it is, we

get rid of any existing bullets by using the

empty()

method, which removes

all the remaining sprites from a group

2

. We also call

_create_fleet()

, which

fills the screen with aliens again.

Now a new fleet appears as soon as you destroy the current fleet.

***Speeding Up the Bullets***

If you've tried firing at the aliens in the game's current state, you might find   
that the bullets aren't traveling at the best speed for gameplay. They might   
be a little too slow or a little too fast. At this point, you can modify the set-  
tings to make the gameplay more interesting. Keep in mind that the game   
is going to get progressively faster, so don't make the game too fast at the   
beginning.

We modify the speed of the bullets by adjusting the value of

bullet_speed

in *settings.py*. On my system, I'll adjust the value of

bullet_speed

to 2.5, so the

bullets travel a little faster:

*settings.py*

# Bullet settings

self.bullet_speed = 2.5  

self.bullet_width = 3

*--snip--*

The best value for this setting depends on your experience of the game,

so find a value that works for you. You can adjust other settings as well.

***Refactoring _update_bullets()***

Let's refactor

_update_bullets()

so it's not doing so many different tasks.

We'll move the code for dealing with bullet-alien collisions to a separate   
method:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_bullets(self):  

*--snip--*

# Get rid of bullets that have disappeared.  
for bullet in self.bullets.copy():  
if bullet.rect.bottom \<= 0:  
self.bullets.remove(bullet)

self._check_bullet_alien_collisions()

def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self):

"""Respond to bullet-alien collisions."""  
# Remove any bullets and aliens that have collided.

collisions = pygame.sprite.groupcollide(  
self.bullets, self.aliens, True, True)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress308.png)

**270**

Chapter 13

if not self.aliens:  
# Destroy existing bullets and create new fleet.  
self.bullets.empty()  
self._create_fleet()

We've created a new method,

_check_bullet_alien_collisions()

, to look

for collisions between bullets and aliens and to respond appropriately if the   
entire fleet has been destroyed. Doing so keeps

_update_bullets()

from grow-

ing too long and simplifies further development.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**13-5. Sideways Shooter Part 2:**

We've come a long way since Exercise 12-6,

*Sideways Shooter*

. For this exercise, try to develop

*Sideways Shooter*

to the

same point we've brought

*Alien Invasion*

to. Add a fleet of aliens, and make

them move sideways toward the ship. Or, write code that places aliens at ran-  
dom positions along the right side of the screen and then sends them toward   
the ship. Also, write code that makes the aliens disappear when they're hit.

**Ending the Game**

What's the fun and challenge in playing a game you can't lose? If the player   
doesn't shoot down the fleet quickly enough, we'll have the aliens destroy   
the ship when they make contact. At the same time, we'll limit the number   
of ships a player can use, and we'll destroy the ship when an alien reaches   
the bottom of the screen. The game will end when the player has used up   
all their ships.

***Detecting Alien-Ship Collisions***

We'll start by checking for collisions between aliens and the ship so we can   
respond appropriately when an alien hits it. We'll check for alien-ship colli-  
sions immediately after updating the position of each alien in

AlienInvasion

:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _update_aliens(self):  

*--snip--*

self.aliens.update()

# Look for alien-ship collisions.

1

if pygame.sprite.spritecollideany(self.ship, self.aliens):

2

print("Ship hit!!!")

The

spritecollideany()

function takes two arguments: a sprite and a

group. The function looks for any member of the group that has collided   
with the sprite and stops looping through the group as soon as it finds one   
member that has collided with the sprite. Here, it loops through the group

aliens

and returns the first alien it finds that has collided with

ship

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress309.png)

Aliens!

**271**

If no collisions occur,

spritecollideany()

returns

None

and the

if

block

won't execute

1

. If it finds an alien that has collided with the ship, it returns

that alien and the

if

block executes: it prints

Ship hit!!!

2

. When an alien

hits the ship, we'll need to do a number of tasks: delete all remaining aliens   
and bullets, recenter the ship, and create a new fleet. Before we write code   
to do all this, we want to know that our approach to detecting alien-ship col-  
lisions works correctly. Writing a

print()

call is a simple way to ensure we're

detecting these collisions properly.

Now when you run *Alien Invasion,* the message *Ship hit!!!* should appear

in the terminal whenever an alien runs into the ship. When you're testing   
this feature, set

fleet_drop_speed

to a higher value, such as 50 or 100, so the

aliens reach your ship faster.

***Responding to Alien-Ship Collisions***

Now we need to figure out exactly what will happen when an alien collides   
with the ship. Instead of destroying the

ship

instance and creating a new

one, we'll count how many times the ship has been hit by tracking statistics   
for the game. Tracking statistics will also be useful for scoring.

Let's write a new class,

GameStats

, to track game statistics, and let's save it

as *game_stats.py*:

*game_stats.py*

class GameStats:  
"""Track statistics for Alien Invasion."""

def __init__(self, ai_game):  
"""Initialize statistics."""  
self.settings = ai_game.settings

1

self.reset_stats()

def reset_stats(self):  
"""Initialize statistics that can change during the game."""  
self.ships_left = self.settings.ship_limit

We'll make one

GameStats

instance for the entire time *Alien Invasion* is

running, but we'll need to reset some statistics each time the player starts a   
new game. To do this, we'll initialize most of the statistics in the

reset_stats()

method, instead of directly in

__init__()

. We'll call this method from

__init__()

so the statistics are set properly when the

GameStats

instance is first created

1

.

But we'll also be able to call

reset_stats()

anytime the player starts a new game.

Right now we have only one statistic,

ships_left

, the value of which will change

throughout the game.

The number of ships the player starts with should be stored in *settings.py*

as

ship_limit

:

*settings.py*

# Ship settings

self.ship_speed = 1.5

self.ship_limit = 3  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress310.png)

**272**

Chapter 13

We also need to make a few changes in *alien_invasion.py* to create an

instance of

GameStats

. First, we'll update the

import

statements at the top of

the file:

*alien_invasion.py*

import sys

from time import sleep

import pygame

from settings import Settings

from game_stats import GameStats

from ship import Ship

*--snip--*

We import the

sleep()

function from the

time

module in the Python

standard library, so we can pause the game for a moment when the ship is   
hit. We also import

GameStats

.

We'll create an instance of

GameStats

in

__init__()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode(  
(self.settings.screen_width, self.settings.screen_height))  
pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Invasion")

# Create an instance to store game statistics.  
self.stats = GameStats(self)

self.ship = Ship(self)  

*--snip--*

We make the instance after creating the game window but before defin-

ing other game elements, such as the ship.

When an alien hits the ship, we'll subtract 1 from the number of ships

left, destroy all existing aliens and bullets, create a new fleet, and reposition   
the ship in the middle of the screen. We'll also pause the game for a moment   
so the player can notice the collision and regroup before a new fleet appears.

Let's put most of this code in a new method called

_ship_hit()

. We'll call

this method from

_update_aliens()

when an alien hits the ship:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _ship_hit(self):  
"""Respond to the ship being hit by an alien."""  
# Decrement ships_left.

1

self.stats.ships_left -= 1

# Get rid of any remaining bullets and aliens.

2

self.bullets.empty()

self.aliens.empty()

# Create a new fleet and center the ship.

3

self._create_fleet()

self.ship.center_ship()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress311.png)

Aliens!

**273**

# Pause.

4

sleep(0.5)

The new method

_ship_hit()

coordinates the response when an alien

hits a ship. Inside

_ship_hit()

, the number of ships left is reduced by 1

1

,

after which we empty the groups

bullets

and

aliens

2

.

Next, we create a new fleet and center the ship

3

. (We'll add the

method

center_ship()

to

Ship

in a moment.) Then we add a pause after the

updates have been made to all the game elements but before any changes   
have been drawn to the screen, so the player can see that their ship has   
been hit

4

. The

sleep()

call pauses program execution for half a second,

long enough for the player to see that the alien has hit the ship. When the

sleep()

function ends, code execution moves on to the

_update_screen()

method, which draws the new fleet to the screen.

In

_update_aliens()

, we replace the

print()

call with a call to

_ship_hit()

when an alien hits the ship:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_aliens(self):

*--snip--*

if pygame.sprite.spritecollideany(self.ship, self.aliens):

self._ship_hit()

Here's the new method

center_ship()

, which belongs in *ship.py*:

*ship.py*

def center_ship(self):  
"""Center the ship on the screen."""  
self.rect.midbottom = self.screen_rect.midbottom  
self.x = float(self.rect.x)

We center the ship the same way we did in

__init__()

. After centering it,

we reset the

self.x

attribute, which allows us to track the ship's exact position.

**N O T E**

*Notice that we never make more than one ship; we make only one ship instance for the*

*whole game and recenter it whenever the ship has been hit. The statistic*

*ships_left*

*will tell us when the player has run out of ships.*

Run the game, shoot a few aliens, and let an alien hit the ship. The game

should pause, and a new fleet should appear with the ship centered at the   
bottom of the screen again.

***Aliens That Reach the Bottom of the Screen***

If an alien reaches the bottom of the screen, we'll have the game respond   
the same way it does when an alien hits the ship. To check when this hap-  
pens, add a new method in *alien_invasion.py*:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_aliens_bottom(self):  
"""Check if any aliens have reached the bottom of the screen."""  
for alien in self.aliens.sprites():  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress312.png)

**274**

Chapter 13

1

if alien.rect.bottom \>= self.settings.screen_height:

# Treat this the same as if the ship got hit.  
self._ship_hit()  
break

The method

_check_aliens_bottom()

checks whether any aliens have reached

the bottom of the screen. An alien reaches the bottom when its

rect.bottom

value is greater than or equal to the screen's height

1

. If an alien reaches the

bottom, we call

_ship_hit()

. If one alien hits the bottom, there's no need to

check the rest, so we break out of the loop after calling

_ship_hit()

.

We'll call this method from

_update_aliens()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_aliens(self):  

*--snip--*

# Look for alien-ship collisions.  
if pygame.sprite.spritecollideany(self.ship, self.aliens):  
self._ship_hit()

# Look for aliens hitting the bottom of the screen.  
self._check_aliens_bottom()

We call

_check_aliens_bottom()

after updating the positions of all the

aliens and after looking for alien-ship collisions. Now a new fleet will   
appear every time the ship is hit by an alien or an alien reaches the bottom   
of the screen.

***Game Over!***

*Alien Invasion* feels more complete now, but the game never ends. The value   
of

ships_left

just grows increasingly negative. Let's add a

game_active

flag, so

we can end the game when the player runs out of ships. We'll set this flag at   
the end of the

__init__()

method in

AlienInvasion

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

# Start Alien Invasion in an active state.

self.game_active = True

Now we add code to

_ship_hit()

that sets

game_active

to

False

when the

player has used up all their ships:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _ship_hit(self):  
"""Respond to ship being hit by alien."""

if self.stats.ships_left \> 0:  

# Decrement ships_left.

self.stats.ships_left -= 1  

*--snip--*

# Pause.  
sleep(0.5)

else:  

self.game_active = False  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress313.png)

Aliens!

**275**

Most of

_ship_hit()

is unchanged. We've moved all the existing code

into an

if

block, which tests to make sure the player has at least one ship

remaining. If so, we create a new fleet, pause, and move on. If the player has   
no ships left, we set

game_active

to

False

.

***Identifying When Parts of the Game Should Run***

We need to identify the parts of the game that should always run and the   
parts that should run only when the game is active:

*alien_invasion.py*

def run_game(self):  
"""Start the main loop for the game."""  
while True:  
self._check_events()

if self.game_active:

self.ship.update()  
self._update_bullets()  
self._update_aliens()

self._update_screen()  
self.clock.tick(60)

In the main loop, we always need to call

_check_events()

, even if the

game is inactive. For example, we still need to know if the user presses Q to   
quit the game or clicks the button to close the window. We also continue   
updating the screen so we can make changes to the screen while waiting to   
see whether the player chooses to start a new game. The rest of the function   
calls need to happen only when the game is active, because when the game   
is inactive, we don't need to update the positions of game elements.

Now when you play *Alien Invasion*, the game should freeze when you've

used up all your ships.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**13-6. Game Over:**

In

*Sideways Shooter*

, keep track of the number of times the

ship is hit and the number of times an alien is hit by the ship. Decide on an   
appropriate condition for ending the game, and stop the game when this situa-  
tion occurs.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to add a large number of identical elements   
to a game by creating a fleet of aliens. You used nested loops to create a   
grid of elements, and you made a large set of game elements move by call-  
ing each element's

update()

method. You learned to control the direction of  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress314.png)

**276**

Chapter 13

objects on the screen and to respond to specific situations, such as when the   
fleet reaches the edge of the screen. You detected and responded to colli-  
sions when bullets hit aliens and aliens hit the ship. You also learned how   
to track statistics in a game and use a

game_active

flag to determine when

the game is over.

In the next and final chapter of this project, we'll add a Play button so

the player can choose when to start their first game and whether to play   
again when the game ends. We'll speed up the game each time the player   
shoots down the entire fleet, and we'll add a scoring system. The final result   
will be a fully playable game!

**S C O R I N G**

In this chapter, we'll finish building *Alien*

*Invasion*. We'll add a Play button to start the

game on demand and to restart the game

once it ends. We'll also change the game so it

speeds up when the player moves up a level, and we'll   
implement a scoring system. By the end of the chap-  
ter, you'll know enough to start writing games that   
increase in difficulty as a player progresses and that   
feature complete scoring systems.

Chapter 14

**Adding the Play Button**

In this section, we'll add a Play button that appears before a game begins   
and reappears when the game ends so the player can play again.

Right now, the game begins as soon as you run *alien_invasion.py*. Let's

start the game in an inactive state and then prompt the player to click a Play   
button to begin. To do this, modify the

__init__()

method of

AlienInvasion

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  
"""Initialize the game, and create game resources."""  
pygame.init()  

*--snip--*

# Start Alien Invasion in an inactive state.  
self.game_active = False

Now the game should start in an inactive state, with no way for the

player to start it until we make a Play button.

***Creating a Button Class***

Because Pygame doesn't have a built-in method for making buttons, we'll   
write a

Button

class to create a filled rectangle with a label. You can use this

code to make any button in a game. Here's the first part of the

Button

class;

save it as *button.py*:

*button.py*

import pygame.font

class Button:  
"""A class to build buttons for the game."""

1

def __init__(self, ai_game, msg):

"""Initialize button attributes."""  
self.screen = ai_game.screen  
self.screen_rect = self.screen.get_rect()

# Set the dimensions and properties of the button.

2

self.width, self.height = 200, 50

self.button_color = (0, 135, 0)  
self.text_color = (255, 255, 255)

3

self.font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 48)

# Build the button's rect object and center it.

4

self.rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.width, self.height)

self.rect.center = self.screen_rect.center

# The button message needs to be prepped only once.

5

self._prep_msg(msg)

First, we import the

pygame.font

module, which lets Pygame render text

to the screen. The

__init__()

method takes the parameters

self

, the

ai_game

object, and

msg

, which contains the button's text

1

. We set the button

dimensions

2

, set

button_color

to color the button's

rect

object dark green,

and set

text_color

to render the text in white.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress317.png)

Scoring

**279**

Next, we prepare a

font

attribute for rendering text

3

. The

None

argu-

ment tells Pygame to use the default font, and

48

specifies the size of the

text. To center the button on the screen, we create a

rect

for the button

4

and set its

center

attribute to match that of the screen.

Pygame works with text by rendering the string you want to display as

an image. Finally, we call

_prep_msg()

to handle this rendering

5

.

Here's the code for

_prep_msg()

:

*button.py*

def _prep_msg(self, msg):  
"""Turn msg into a rendered image and center text on the button."""

1

self.msg_image = self.font.render(msg, True, self.text_color,

self.button_color)

2

self.msg_image_rect = self.msg_image.get_rect()

self.msg_image_rect.center = self.rect.center

The

_prep_msg()

method needs a

self

parameter and the text to be ren-

dered as an image (

msg

). The call to

font.render()

turns the text stored in

msg

into an image, which we then store in

self.msg_image

1

. The

font.render()

method also takes a Boolean value to turn antialiasing on or off (*antialiasing*   
makes the edges of the text smoother). The remaining arguments are the   
specified font color and background color. We set antialiasing to

True

and set

the text background to the same color as the button. (If you don't include   
a background color, Pygame will try to render the font with a transparent   
background.)

We center the text image on the button by creating a

rect

from the

image and setting its

center

attribute to match that of the button

2

.

Finally, we create a

draw_button()

method that we can call to display the

button onscreen:

*button.py*

def draw_button(self):  
"""Draw blank button and then draw message."""  
self.screen.fill(self.button_color, self.rect)  
self.screen.blit(self.msg_image, self.msg_image_rect)

We call

screen.fill()

to draw the rectangular portion of the button. Then

we call

screen.blit()

to draw the text image to the screen, passing it an image

and the

rect

object associated with the image. This completes the

Button

class.

***Drawing the Button to the Screen***

We'll use the

Button

class to create a Play button in

AlienInvasion

. First, we'll

update the

import

statements:

*alien_invasion.py*

*--snip--*

from game_stats import GameStats

from button import Button  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress318.png)

**280**

Chapter 14

Because we need only one Play button, we'll create the button in the

__init__()

method of

AlienInvasion

. We can place this code at the very end

of

__init__()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

self.game_active = False

# Make the Play button.  
self.play_button = Button(self, "Play")

This code creates an instance of

Button

with the label

Play

, but it doesn't

draw the button to the screen. To do this, we'll call the button's

draw_button()

method in

_update_screen()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_screen(self):  

*--snip--*

self.aliens.draw(self.screen)

# Draw the play button if the game is inactive.  
if not self.game_active:  
self.play_button.draw_button()

pygame.display.flip()

To make the Play button visible above all other elements on the screen,

we draw it after all the other elements have been drawn but before flipping   
to a new screen. We include it in an

if

block, so the button only appears

when the game is inactive.

Now when you run *Alien Invasion*, you should see a Play button in the

center of the screen, as shown in Figure 14-1.

*Figure 14-1: A Play button appears when the game is inactive.*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress319.png)

Scoring

**281**

***Starting the Game***

To start a new game when the player clicks Play, add the following

elif

block to the end of

_check_events()

to monitor mouse events over the button:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_events(self):  
"""Respond to keypresses and mouse events."""  
for event in pygame.event.get():  
if event.type == pygame.QUIT:  

*--snip--*

1

elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:

2

mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()

3

self._check_play_button(mouse_pos)

Pygame detects a

MOUSEBUTTONDOWN

event when the player clicks anywhere

on the screen

1

, but we want to restrict our game to respond to mouse clicks

only on the Play button. To accomplish this, we use

pygame.mouse.get_pos()

,

which returns a tuple containing the mouse cursor's *x* - and *y* -coordinates   
when the mouse button is clicked

2

. We send these values to the new method

_check_play_button()

3

.

Here's

_check_play_button()

, which I chose to place after

_check_events()

:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):  
"""Start a new game when the player clicks Play."""

1

if self.play_button.rect.collidepoint(mouse_pos):

self.game_active = True

We use the

rect

method

collidepoint()

to check whether the point of

the mouse click overlaps the region defined by the Play button's

rect

1

. If

so, we set

game_active

to

True

, and the game begins!

At this point, you should be able to start and play a full game. When the

game ends, the value of

game_active

should become

False

and the Play but-

ton should reappear.

***Resetting the Game***

The Play button code we just wrote works the first time the player clicks   
Play. But it doesn't work after the first game ends, because the conditions   
that caused the game to end haven't been reset.

To reset the game each time the player clicks Play, we need to reset the

game statistics, clear out the old aliens and bullets, build a new fleet, and   
center the ship, as shown here:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):  
"""Start a new game when the player clicks Play."""  
if self.play_button.rect.collidepoint(mouse_pos):

# Reset the game statistics.

1

self.stats.reset_stats()

self.game_active = True  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress320.png)

**282**

Chapter 14

# Get rid of any remaining bullets and aliens.

2

self.bullets.empty()

self.aliens.empty()

# Create a new fleet and center the ship.

3

self._create_fleet()

self.ship.center_ship()

We reset the game statistics

1

, which gives the player three new ships.

Then we set

game_active

to

True

so the game will begin as soon as the code in

this function finishes running. We empty the

aliens

and

bullets

groups

2

,

and then we create a new fleet and center the ship

3

.

Now the game will reset properly each time you click Play, allowing you

to play it as many times as you want!

***Deactivating the Play Button***

One issue with our Play button is that the button region on the screen will   
continue to respond to clicks even when the Play button isn't visible. If you   
click the Play button area by accident after a game begins, the game will   
restart!

To fix this, set the game to start only when

game_active

is

False

:

*alien*

*_invasion.py*

def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):  
"""Start a new game when the player clicks Play."""

1

button_clicked = self.play_button.rect.collidepoint(mouse_pos)

2

if button_clicked and not self.game_active:

# Reset the game statistics.  
self.stats.reset_stats()  

*--snip--*

The flag

button_clicked

stores a

True

or

False

value

1

, and the game will

restart only if Play is clicked *and* the game is not currently active

2

. To test

this behavior, start a new game and repeatedly click where the Play button   
should be. If everything works as expected, clicking the Play button area   
should have no effect on the gameplay.

***Hiding the Mouse Cursor***

We want the mouse cursor to be visible when the game is inactive, but   
once play begins, it just gets in the way. To fix this, we'll make it invisible   
when the game becomes active. We can do this at the end of the

if

block in

_check_play_button()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):  
"""Start a new game when the player clicks Play."""  
button_clicked = self.play_button.rect.collidepoint(mouse_pos)  
if button_clicked and not self.game_active:  

*--snip--*

# Hide the mouse cursor.  
pygame.mouse.set_visible(False)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress321.png)

Scoring

**283**

Passing

False

to

set_visible()

tells Pygame to hide the cursor when the

mouse is over the game window.

We'll make the cursor reappear once the game ends so the player can

click Play again to begin a new game. Here's the code to do that:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _ship_hit(self):  
"""Respond to ship being hit by alien."""  
if self.stats.ships_left \> 0:  

*--snip--*

else:  
self.game_active = False  

pygame.mouse.set_visible(True)

We make the cursor visible again as soon as the game becomes inactive,

which happens in

_ship_hit()

. Attention to details like this makes your game

more professional looking and allows the player to focus on playing, rather   
than figuring out the user interface.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**14-1. Press P to Play:**

Because

*Alien Invasion*

uses keyboard input to control the

ship, it would be useful to start the game with a keypress. Add code that lets the   
player press P to start. It might help to move some code from

_check_play_button()

to a

_start_game()

method that can be called from

_check_play_button()

*and*

_check_keydown_events()

.

**14-2. Target Practice:**

Create a rectangle at the right edge of the screen that

moves up and down at a steady rate. Then on the left side of the screen, cre-  
ate a ship that the player can move up and down while firing bullets at the   
rectangular target. Add a Play button that starts the game, and when the player   
misses the target three times, end the game and make the Play button reappear.   
Let the player restart the game with this Play button.

**Leveling Up**

In our current game, once a player shoots down the entire alien fleet, the   
player reaches a new level, but the game difficulty doesn't change. Let's   
liven things up a bit and make the game more challenging by increasing   
the game's speed each time a player clears the screen.

***Modifying the Speed Settings***

We'll first reorganize the

Settings

class to group the game settings into

static and dynamic ones. We'll also make sure any settings that change  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress322.png)

**284**

Chapter 14

during the game reset when we start a new game. Here's the

__init__()

method for *settings.py*:

*settings.py*

def __init__(self):

"""Initialize the game's static settings."""  

# Screen settings

self.screen_width = 1200  
self.screen_height = 800  
self.bg_color = (230, 230, 230)

# Ship settings  
self.ship_limit = 3

# Bullet settings  
self.bullet_width = 3  
self.bullet_height = 15  
self.bullet_color = 60, 60, 60  
self.bullets_allowed = 3

# Alien settings  
self.fleet_drop_speed = 10

# How quickly the game speeds up

1

self.speedup_scale = 1.1

2

self.initialize_dynamic_settings()

We continue to initialize settings that stay constant in the

__init__()

method. We add a

speedup_scale

setting

1

to control how quickly the game

speeds up: a value of 2 will double the game speed every time the player   
reaches a new level; a value of 1 will keep the speed constant. A value like

1.1

should increase the speed enough to make the game challenging but

not impossible. Finally, we call the

initialize_dynamic_settings()

method

to initialize the values for attributes that need to change throughout the   
game

2

.

Here's the code for

initialize_dynamic_settings()

:

*settings.py*

def initialize_dynamic_settings(self):

"""Initialize settings that change throughout the game."""

self.ship_speed = 1.5

self.bullet_speed = 2.5

self.alien_speed = 1.0

# fleet_direction of 1 represents right; -1 represents left.

self.fleet_direction = 1

This method sets the initial values for the ship, bullet, and alien

speeds. We'll increase these speeds as the player progresses in the game   
and reset them each time the player starts a new game. We include

fleet

_direction

in this method so the aliens always move right at the beginning

of a new game. We don't need to increase the value of

fleet_drop_speed

,  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress323.png)

Scoring

**285**

because when the aliens move faster across the screen, they'll also come   
down the screen faster.

To increase the speeds of the ship, bullets, and aliens each time the

player reaches a new level, we'll write a new method called

increase_speed()

:

*settings.py*

def increase_speed(self):

"""Increase speed settings."""

self.ship_speed \*= self.speedup_scale

self.bullet_speed \*= self.speedup_scale

self.alien_speed \*= self.speedup_scale

To increase the speed of these game elements, we multiply each speed

setting by the value of

speedup_scale

.

We increase the game's tempo by calling

increase_speed()

in

_check

_bullet_alien_collisions()

when the last alien in a fleet has been shot down:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self):  

*--snip--*

if not self.aliens:  
# Destroy existing bullets and create new fleet.  
self.bullets.empty()  
self._create_fleet()  

self.settings.increase_speed()

Changing the values of the speed settings

ship_speed

,

alien_speed

, and

bullet_speed

is enough to speed up the entire game!

***Resetting the Speed***

Now we need to return any changed settings to their initial values each time   
the player starts a new game; otherwise, each new game would start with   
the increased speed settings of the previous game:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):  
"""Start a new game when the player clicks Play."""  
button_clicked = self.play_button.rect.collidepoint(mouse_pos)  
if button_clicked and not self.game_active:  

# Reset the game settings.

self.settings.initialize_dynamic_settings()

*--snip--*

Playing *Alien Invasion* should be more fun and challenging now. Each

time you clear the screen, the game should speed up and become slightly   
more difficult. If the game becomes too difficult too quickly, decrease the   
value of

settings.speedup_scale

. Or if the game isn't challenging enough,

increase the value slightly. Find a sweet spot by ramping up the difficulty in   
a reasonable amount of time. The first couple of screens should be easy, the   
next few should be challenging but doable, and subsequent screens should   
be almost impossibly difficult.

Chapter 14

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**14-3. Challenging Target Practice:**

Start with your work from Exercise 14-2

([page 283)](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#321). Make the target move faster as the game progresses, and restart   
the target at the original speed when the player clicks Play.

**14-4. Difficulty Levels:**

Make a set of buttons for

*Alien Invasion*

that allows the

player to select an appropriate starting difficulty level for the game. Each but-  
ton should assign the appropriate values for the attributes in

Settings

needed

to create different difficulty levels.

**Scoring**

Let's implement a scoring system to track the game's score in real time and   
display the high score, level, and number of ships remaining.

The score is a game statistic, so we'll add a

score

attribute to

GameStats

:

*game_stats.py*

class GameStats:  

*--snip--*

def reset_stats(self):  
"""Initialize statistics that can change during the game."""  
self.ships_left = self.ai_settings.ship_limit

self.score = 0

To reset the score each time a new game starts, we initialize

score

in

reset_stats()

rather than

__init__()

.

***Displaying the Score***

To display the score on the screen, we first create a new class,

Scoreboard

. For

now, this class will just display the current score. Eventually, we'll use it to   
report the high score, level, and number of ships remaining as well. Here's   
the first part of the class; save it as *scoreboard.py*:

*scoreboard.py*

import pygame.font

class Scoreboard:  
"""A class to report scoring information."""

1

def __init__(self, ai_game):

"""Initialize scorekeeping attributes."""  
self.screen = ai_game.screen  
self.screen_rect = self.screen.get_rect()  
self.settings = ai_game.settings  
self.stats = ai_game.stats

# Font settings for scoring information.

2

self.text_color = (30, 30, 30)

3

self.font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 48)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress325.png)

Scoring

**287**

# Prepare the initial score image.

4

self.prep_score()

Because

Scoreboard

writes text to the screen, we begin by importing the

pygame.font

module. Next, we give

__init__()

the

ai_game

parameter so it can

access the

settings

,

screen

, and

stats

objects, which it will need to report the

values we're tracking

1

. Then we set a text color

2

and instantiate a font

object

3

.

To turn the text to be displayed into an image, we call

prep_score()

4

,

which we define here:

*scoreboard.py*

def prep_score(self):  
"""Turn the score into a rendered image."""

1

score_str = str(self.stats.score)

2

self.score_image = self.font.render(score_str, True,

self.text_color, self.settings.bg_color)

# Display the score at the top right of the screen.

3

self.score_rect = self.score_image.get_rect()

4

self.score_rect.right = self.screen_rect.right - 20

5

self.score_rect.top = 20

In

prep_score()

, we turn the numerical value

stats.score

into a string

1

and then pass this string to

render()

, which creates the image

2

. To display

the score clearly onscreen, we pass the screen's background color and the   
text color to

render()

.

We'll position the score in the upper-right corner of the screen and

have it expand to the left as the score increases and the width of the num-  
ber grows. To make sure the score always lines up with the right side of   
the screen, we create a

rect

called

score_rect

3

and set its right edge 20 pixels

from the right edge of the screen

4

. We then place the top edge 20 pixels

down from the top of the screen

5

.

Then we create a

show_score()

method to display the rendered score

image:

*scoreboard.py*

def show_score(self):  
"""Draw score to the screen."""  
self.screen.blit(self.score_image, self.score_rect)

This method draws the score image onscreen at the location

score_rect

specifies.

***Making a Scoreboard***

To display the score, we'll create a

Scoreboard

instance in

AlienInvasion

. First,

let's update the

import

statements:

*alien_invasion.py*

*--snip--*

from game_stats import GameStats

from scoreboard import Scoreboard

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress326.png)

**288**

Chapter 14

Next, we make an instance of

Scoreboard

in

__init__()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Invasion")

# Create an instance to store game statistics,  
# and create a scoreboard.  

self.stats = GameStats(self)

self.sb = Scoreboard(self)

*--snip--*

Then we draw the scoreboard onscreen in

_update_screen()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _update_screen(self):  

*--snip--*

self.aliens.draw(self.screen)

# Draw the score information.  
self.sb.show_score()

# Draw the play button if the game is inactive.  

*--snip--*

We call

show_score()

just before we draw the Play button.

When you run *Alien Invasion* now, a 0 should appear at the top right of

the screen. (At this point, we just want to make sure the score appears in   
the right place before developing the scoring system further.) Figure 14-2   
shows the score as it appears before the game starts.

Next, we'll assign point values to each alien!

*Figure 14-2: The score appears at the top-right corner of the screen.*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress327.png)

Scoring

**289**

***Updating the Score as Aliens Are Shot Down***

To write a live score onscreen, we update the value of

stats.score

whenever

an alien is hit, and then call

prep_score()

to update the score image. But

first, let's determine how many points a player gets each time they shoot   
down an alien:

*settings.py*

def initialize_dynamic_settings(self):  

*--snip--*

# Scoring settings

self.alien_points = 50

We'll increase each alien's point value as the game progresses. To make

sure this point value is reset each time a new game starts, we set the value in

initialize_dynamic_settings()

.

Let's update the score in

_check_bullet_alien_collisions()

each time an

alien is shot down:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self):  
"""Respond to bullet-alien collisions."""  
# Remove any bullets and aliens that have collided.  
collisions = pygame.sprite.groupcollide(  
self.bullets, self.aliens, True, True)

if collisions:  
self.stats.score += self.settings.alien_points  
self.sb.prep_score()

*--snip--*

When a bullet hits an alien, Pygame returns a

collisions

dictionary.

We check whether the dictionary exists, and if it does, the alien's value is   
added to the score. We then call

prep_score()

to create a new image for the

updated score.

Now when you play *Alien Invasion*, you should be able to rack up points!

***Resetting the Score***

Right now, we're only prepping a new score *after* an alien has been hit,   
which works for most of the game. But when we start a new game, we'll still   
see our score from the old game until the first alien is hit.

We can fix this by prepping the score when starting a new game:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):  

*--snip--*

if button_clicked and not self.game_active:  

*--snip--*

# Reset the game statistics.  
self.stats.reset_stats()

self.sb.prep_score()

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress328.png)

**290**

Chapter 14

We call

prep_score()

after resetting the game stats when starting a new

game. This preps the scoreboard with a score of 0.

***Making Sure to Score All Hits***

As currently written, our code could miss scoring for some aliens. For example,   
if two bullets collide with aliens during the same pass through the loop or   
if we make an extra-wide bullet to hit multiple aliens, the player will only   
receive points for hitting one of the aliens. To fix this, let's refine the way   
that bullet-alien collisions are detected.

In

_check_bullet_alien_collisions()

, any bullet that collides with an alien

becomes a key in the

collisions

dictionary. The value associated with each

bullet is a list of aliens it has collided with. We loop through the values in   
the

collisions

dictionary to make sure we award points for each alien hit:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self):  

*--snip--*

if collisions:

for aliens in collisions.values():  
self.stats.score += self.settings.alien_points \* len(aliens)

self.sb.prep_score()  

*--snip--*

If the

collisions

dictionary has been defined, we loop through all values

in the dictionary. Remember that each value is a list of aliens hit by a single   
bullet. We multiply the value of each alien by the number of aliens in each list   
and add this amount to the current score. To test this, change the width of   
a bullet to 300 pixels and verify that you receive points for each alien you hit   
with your extra-wide bullets; then return the bullet width to its normal value.

***Increasing Point Values***

Because the game gets more difficult each time a player reaches a new level,   
aliens in later levels should be worth more points. To implement this func-  
tionality, we'll add code to increase the point value when the game's speed   
increases:

*settings.py*

class Settings:  
"""A class to store all settings for Alien Invasion."""

def __init__(self):  

*--snip--*

# How quickly the game speeds up

self.speedup_scale = 1.1  

# How quickly the alien point values increase

1

self.score_scale = 1.5

self.initialize_dynamic_settings()

def initialize_dynamic_settings(self):  

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress329.png)

Scoring

**291**

def increase_speed(self):

"""Increase speed settings and alien point values."""

self.ship_speed \*= self.speedup_scale  
self.bullet_speed \*= self.speedup_scale  
self.alien_speed \*= self.speedup_scale

2

self.alien_points = int(self.alien_points \* self.score_scale)

We define a rate at which points increase, which we call

score_scale

1

.

A small increase in speed (

1.1

) makes the game more challenging quickly.

But to see a more notable difference in scoring, we need to change the alien   
point value by a larger amount (

1.5

). Now when we increase the game's

speed, we also increase the point value of each hit

2

. We use the

int()

func-

tion to increase the point value by whole integers.

To see the value of each alien, add a

print()

call to the

increase_speed()

method in

Settings

:

*settings.py*

def increase_speed(self):  

*--snip--*

self.alien_points = int(self.alien_points \* self.score_scale)  

print(self.alien_points)

The new point value should appear in the terminal every time you

reach a new level.

**N O T E**

*Be sure to remove the*

*print()*

*call after verifying that the point value is increasing, or*

*it might affect your game's performance and distract the player.*

***Rounding the Score***

Most arcade-style shooting games report scores as multiples of 10, so let's fol-  
low that lead with our scores. Also, let's format the score to include comma   
separators in large numbers. We'll make this change in

Scoreboard

:

*scoreboard.py*

def prep_score(self):  
"""Turn the score into a rendered image."""

rounded_score = round(self.stats.score, -1)  

score_str = f"{rounded_score:,}"

self.score_image = self.font.render(score_str, True,  
self.text_color, self.settings.bg_color)  

*--snip--*

The

round()

function normally rounds a float to a set number of deci-

mal places given as the second argument. However, when you pass a nega-  
tive number as the second argument,

round()

will round the value to the

nearest 10, 100, 1,000, and so on. This code tells Python to round the value   
of

stats.score

to the nearest 10 and assign it to

rounded_score

.

We then use a format specifier in the f-string for the score. A *format*

*specifier* is a special sequence of characters that modifies the way a vari-  
able's value is presented. In this case the sequence

:,

tells Python to insert  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress330.png)

**292**

Chapter 14

commas at appropriate places in the numerical value that's provided. This   
results in strings like

1,000,000

instead of

1000000

.

Now when you run the game, you should see a neatly formatted, rounded

score even when you rack up lots of points, as shown in Figure 14-3.

*Figure 14-3: A rounded score with comma separators*

***High Scores***

Every player wants to beat a game's high score, so let's track and report high   
scores to give players something to work toward. We'll store high scores in

GameStats

:

*game_stats.py*

def __init__(self, ai_game):  

*--snip--*

# High score should never be reset.

self.high_score = 0

Because the high score should never be reset, we initialize

high_score

in

__init__()

rather than in

reset_stats()

.

Next, we'll modify

Scoreboard

to display the high score. Let's start with

the

__init__()

method:

*scoreboard.py*

def __init__(self, ai_game):  

*--snip--*

# Prepare the initial score images.

self.prep_score()

1

self.prep_high_score()

The high score will be displayed separately from the score, so we need a

new method,

prep_high_score()

, to prepare the high-score image

1

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress331.png)

Scoring

**293**

Here's the

prep_high_score()

method:

*scoreboard.py*

def prep_high_score(self):

"""Turn the high score into a rendered image."""

1

high_score = round(self.stats.high_score, -1)

high_score_str = f"{high_score:,}"

2

self.high_score_image = self.font.render(high_score_str, True,

self.text_color, self.settings.bg_color)

# Center the high score at the top of the screen.

self.high_score_rect = self.high_score_image.get_rect()

3

self.high_score_rect.centerx = self.screen_rect.centerx

4

self.high_score_rect.top = self.score_rect.top

We round the high score to the nearest 10 and format it with com-

mas

1

. We then generate an image from the high score

2

, center the

high score

rect

horizontally

3

, and set its

top

attribute to match the top

of the score image

4

.

The

show_score()

method now draws the current score at the top right

and the high score at the top center of the screen:

*scoreboard.py*

def show_score(self):  
"""Draw score to the screen."""  
self.screen.blit(self.score_image, self.score_rect)

self.screen.blit(self.high_score_image, self.high_score_rect)

To check for high scores, we'll write a new method,

check_high_score()

,

in

Scoreboard

:

*scoreboard.py*

def check_high_score(self):  
"""Check to see if there's a new high score."""  
if self.stats.score \> self.stats.high_score:  
self.stats.high_score = self.stats.score  
self.prep_high_score()

The method

check_high_score()

checks the current score against the

high score. If the current score is greater, we update the value of

high_score

and call

prep_high_score()

to update the high score's image.

We need to call

check_high_score()

each time an alien is hit after updat-

ing the score in

_check_bullet_alien_collisions()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self):  

*--snip--*

if collisions:  
for aliens in collisions.values():  
self.stats.score += self.settings.alien_points \* len(aliens)  
self.sb.prep_score()  

self.sb.check_high_score()

*--snip--*

We call

check_high_score()

when the

collisions

dictionary is present, and

we do so after updating the score for all the aliens that have been hit.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress332.png)

**294**

Chapter 14

The first time you play *Alien Invasion*, your score will be the high score,

so it will be displayed as the current score and the high score. But when you   
start a second game, your high score should appear in the middle and your   
current score should appear at the right, as shown in Figure 14-4.

*Figure 14-4: The high score is shown at the top center of the screen.*

***Displaying the Level***

To display the player's level in the game, we first need an attribute in

GameStats

representing the current level. To reset the level at the start of

each new game, initialize it in

reset_stats()

:

*game_stats.py*

def reset_stats(self):  
"""Initialize statistics that can change during the game."""  
self.ships_left = self.settings.ship_limit  
self.score = 0  

self.level = 1

To have

Scoreboard

display the current level, we call a new method,

prep_level()

, from

__init__()

:

*scoreboard.py*

def __init__(self, ai_game):  

*--snip--*

self.prep_high_score()

self.prep_level()

Here's

prep_level()

:

*scoreboard.py*

def prep_level(self):  
"""Turn the level into a rendered image."""  
level_str = str(self.stats.level)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress333.png)

Scoring

**295**

1

self.level_image = self.font.render(level_str, True,

self.text_color, self.settings.bg_color)

# Position the level below the score.  
self.level_rect = self.level_image.get_rect()

2

self.level_rect.right = self.score_rect.right

3

self.level_rect.top = self.score_rect.bottom + 10

The

prep_level()

method creates an image from the value stored in

stats.level

1

and sets the image's

right

attribute to match the score's

right

attribute

2

. It then sets the

top

attribute 10 pixels beneath the bottom of

the score image to leave space between the score and the level

3

.

We also need to update

show_score()

:

*scoreboard.py*

def show_score(self):

"""Draw scores and level to the screen."""

self.screen.blit(self.score_image, self.score_rect)  
self.screen.blit(self.high_score_image, self.high_score_rect)  

self.screen.blit(self.level_image, self.level_rect)

This new line draws the level image to the screen.  
We'll increment

stats.level

and update the level image in

_check_bullet

_alien_collisions()

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_bullet_alien_collisions(self):  

*--snip--*

if not self.aliens:  

# Destroy existing bullets and create new fleet.

self.bullets.empty()  
self._create_fleet()  
self.settings.increase_speed()

# Increase level.  
self.stats.level += 1  
self.sb.prep_level()

If a fleet is destroyed, we increment the value of

stats.level

and call

prep_level()

to make sure the new level displays correctly.

To ensure the level image updates properly at the start of a new game,

we also call

prep_level()

when the player clicks the Play button:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):  

*--snip--*

if button_clicked and not self.game_active:  

*--snip--*

self.sb.prep_score()

self.sb.prep_level()  

*--snip--*

We call

prep_level()

right after calling

prep_score()

.

Now you'll see how many levels you've completed, as shown in

Figure 14-5.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress334.png)

**296**

Chapter 14

*Figure 14-5: The current level appears just below the current score.*

**N O T E**

*In some classic games, the scores have labels, such as Score, High Score, and Level.*

*We've omitted these labels because the meaning of each number becomes clear once
you've played the game. To include these labels, add them to the score strings just
before the calls to*

*font.render()*

*in*

*Scoreboard*

*.*

***Displaying the Number of Ships***

Finally, let's display the number of ships the player has left, but this time,   
let's use a graphic. To do so, we'll draw ships in the upper-left corner of   
the screen to represent how many ships are left, just as many classic arcade   
games do.

First, we need to make

Ship

inherit from

Sprite

so we can create a group

of ships:

*ship.py*

import pygame

from pygame.sprite import Sprite

1

class Ship(Sprite):

"""A class to manage the ship."""

def __init__(self, ai_game):  
"""Initialize the ship and set its starting position."""

2

super().__init__()

*--snip--*

Here we import

Sprite

, make sure

Ship

inherits from

Sprite

1

, and call

super()

at the beginning of

__init__()

2

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress335.png)

Scoring

**297**

Next, we need to modify

Scoreboard

to create a group of ships we can

display. Here are the

import

statements for

Scoreboard

:

*scoreboard.py*

import pygame.font

from pygame.sprite import Group

from ship import Ship

Because we're making a group of ships, we import the

Group

and

Ship

classes.

Here's

__init__()

:

*scoreboard.py*

def __init__(self, ai_game):  
"""Initialize scorekeeping attributes."""  

self.ai_game = ai_game

self.screen = ai_game.screen  

*--snip--*

self.prep_level()

self.prep_ships()

We assign the game instance to an attribute, because we'll need it to

create some ships. We call

prep_ships()

after the call to

prep_level()

.

Here's

prep_ships()

:

*scoreboard.py*

def prep_ships(self):  
"""Show how many ships are left."""

1

self.ships = Group()

2

for ship_number in range(self.stats.ships_left):

ship = Ship(self.ai_game)

3

ship.rect.x = 10 + ship_number \* ship.rect.width

4

ship.rect.y = 10

5

self.ships.add(ship)

The

prep_ships()

method creates an empty group,

self.ships

, to hold

the ship instances

1

. To fill this group, a loop runs once for every ship the

player has left

2

. Inside the loop, we create a new ship and set each ship's

*x* -coordinate value so the ships appear next to each other with a 10-pixel   
margin on the left side of the group of ships

3

. We set the *y*-coordinate

value 10 pixels down from the top of the screen so the ships appear in the   
upper-left corner of the screen

4

. Then we add each new ship to the group

ships

5

.

Now we need to draw the ships to the screen:

*scoreboard.py*

def show_score(self):

"""Draw scores, level, and ships to the screen."""

self.screen.blit(self.score_image, self.score_rect)  
self.screen.blit(self.high_score_image, self.high_score_rect)  
self.screen.blit(self.level_image, self.level_rect)

self.ships.draw(self.screen)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress336.png)

**298**

Chapter 14

To display the ships on the screen, we call

draw()

on the group, and

Pygame draws each ship.

To show the player how many ships they have to start with, we call

prep_ships()

when a new game starts. We do this in

_check_play_button()

in

AlienInvasion

:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):  

*--snip--*

if button_clicked and not self.game_active:  

*--snip--*

self.sb.prep_level()

self.sb.prep_ships()  

*--snip--*

We also call

prep_ships()

when a ship is hit, to update the display of ship

images when the player loses a ship:

*alien_invasion.py*

def _ship_hit(self):  
"""Respond to ship being hit by alien."""  
if self.stats.ships_left \> 0:

# Decrement ships_left, and update scoreboard.

self.stats.ships_left -= 1

self.sb.prep_ships()  

*--snip--*

We call

prep_ships()

after decreasing the value of

ships_left

, so the cor-

rect number of remaining ships displays each time a ship is destroyed.

Figure 14-6 shows the complete scoring system, with the remaining

ships displayed at the top left of the screen.

*Figure 14-6: The complete scoring system for*

Alien Invasion

Scoring

**299**

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**14-5. All-Time High Score:**

The high score is reset every time a player closes

and restarts

*Alien Invasion*

. Fix this by writing the high score to a file before

calling

sys.exit()

and reading in the high score when initializing its value in

GameStats

.

**14-6. Refactoring:**

Look for methods that are doing more than one task, and

refactor them to organize your code and make it efficient. For example, move   
some of the code in

_check_bullet_alien_collisions()

, which starts a new

level when the fleet of aliens has been destroyed, to a function called

start

_new_level()

. Also, move the four separate method calls in the

__init__()

method

in

Scoreboard

to a method called

prep_images()

to shorten

__init__()

. The

prep

_images()

method could also help simplify

_check_play_button()

or

start_game()

if you've already refactored

_check_play_button()

.

**N O T E**

*Before attempting to refactor the project, se[e Appendix D](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#521)* *to learn*

*how to restore the project to a working state if you introduce bugs
while refactoring.*

**14-7. Expanding the Game:**

Think of a way to expand

*Alien Invasion*

. For

example, you could program the aliens to shoot bullets down at your ship. You   
can also add shields for your ship to hide behind, which can be destroyed by   
bullets from either side. Or you can use something like the

pygame.mixer

module

to add sound effects, such as explosions and shooting sounds.

**14-8. Sideways Shooter, Final Version:**

Continue developing

*Sideways Shooter*

,

using everything we've done in this project. Add a Play button, make the game   
speed up at appropriate points, and develop a scoring system. Be sure to refac-  
tor your code as you work, and look for opportunities to customize the game   
beyond what has been shown in this chapter.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to implement a Play button to start a new   
game. You also learned how to detect mouse events and hide the cursor in   
active games. You can use what you've learned to create other buttons, like a   
Help button to display instructions on how to play your games. You also learned   
how to modify the speed of a game as it progresses, implement a progressive   
scoring system, and display information in textual and nontextual ways.

*Data visualization* is the use of visual repre-

sentations to explore and present patterns

in datasets. It's closely associated with *data*

*analysis*, which uses code to explore the pat-

terns and connections in a dataset. A dataset can be a   
small list of numbers that fits in a single line of code,   
or it can be terabytes of data that include many differ-  
ent kinds of information.

Creating effective data visualizations is about more than just making

information look nice. When a representation of a dataset is simple and   
visually appealing, its meaning becomes clear to viewers. People will see   
patterns and significance in your datasets that they never knew existed.

Fortunately, you don't need a supercomputer to visualize complex data.

Python is so efficient that with just a laptop, you can quickly explore data-  
sets containing millions of individual data points. These data points don't

Chapter 15

have to be numbers; with the basics you learned in the first part of this   
book, you can analyze non-numerical data as well.

People use Python for data-intensive work in genetics, climate research,

political and economic analysis, and much more. Data scientists have writ-  
ten an impressive array of visualization and analysis tools in Python, many of   
which are available to you as well. One of the most popular tools is Matplotlib,   
a mathematical plotting library. In this chapter, we'll use Matplotlib to make   
simple plots, such as line graphs and scatter plots. Then we'll create a more   
interesting dataset based on the concept of a random walk---a visualization   
generated from a series of random decisions.

We'll also use a package called Plotly, which creates visualizations that

work well on digital devices, to analyze the results of rolling dice. Plotly gener-  
ates visualizations that automatically resize to fit a variety of display devices.   
These visualizations can also include a number of interactive features, such as   
emphasizing particular aspects of the dataset when users hover over different   
parts of the visualization. Learning to use Matplotlib and Plotly will help you   
get started visualizing the kinds of data you're most interested in.

**Installing Matplotlib**

To use Matplotlib for your initial set of visualizations, you'll need to install   
it using pip, just like we did with pytest i[n Chapter 11 (s](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#247)ee "[Installing pytest
with pip](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#248)" on page [210).](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#248)

To install Matplotlib, enter the following command at a terminal prompt:

$

**python -m pip install --user matplotlib**

If you use a command other than

**python**

to run programs or start a ter-

minal session, such as

**python3**

, your command will look like this:

$

**python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib**

To see the kinds of visualizations you can make with Matplotlib, visit the

Matplotlib home page at [*https://matplotlib.org*](https://matplotlib.org) and click **Plot types** . When you   
click a visualization in the gallery, you'll see the code used to generate the plot.

**Plotting a Simple Line Graph**

Let's plot a simple line graph using Matplotlib and then customize it to   
create a more informative data visualization. We'll use the square number   
sequence 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 as the data for the graph.

To make a simple line graph, specify the numbers you want to work

with and let Matplotlib do the rest:

*mpl_squares.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

squares = \[1, 4, 9, 16, 25\]  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress341.png)

Generating Data

**303**

1

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(squares)

plt.show()

We first import the

pyplot

module using the alias

plt

so we don't have to

type

pyplot

repeatedly. (You'll see this convention often in online examples,

so we'll use it here.) The

pyplot

module contains a number of functions that

help generate charts and plots.

We create a list called

squares

to hold the data that we'll plot. Then we

follow another common Matplotlib convention by calling the

subplots()

function

1

. This function can generate one or more plots in the same

figure. The variable

fig

represents the entire *figure*, which is the collection

of plots that are generated. The variable

ax

represents a single plot in the

figure; this is the variable we'll use most of the time when defining and cus-  
tomizing a single plot.

We then use the

plot()

method, which tries to plot the data it's given in

a meaningful way. The function

plt.show()

opens Matplotlib's viewer and

displays the plot, as shown in Figure 15-1. The viewer allows you to zoom   
and navigate the plot, and you can save any plot images you like by clicking   
the disk icon.

*Figure 15-1: One of the simplest plots you can make in Matplotlib*

***Changing the Label Type and Line Thickness***

Although the plot in Figure 15-1 shows that the numbers are increasing, the   
label type is too small and the line is a little thin to read easily. Fortunately,   
Matplotlib allows you to adjust every feature of a visualization.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress342.png)

**304**

Chapter 15

We'll use a few of the available customizations to improve this plot's

readability. Let's start by adding a title and labeling the axes:

*mpl_squares.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

squares = \[1, 4, 9, 16, 25\]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

1

ax.plot(squares, linewidth=3)

# Set chart title and label axes.

2

ax.set_title("Square Numbers", fontsize=24)

3

ax.set_xlabel("Value", fontsize=14)

ax.set_ylabel("Square of Value", fontsize=14)

# Set size of tick labels.

4

ax.tick_params(labelsize=14)

plt.show()

The

linewidth

parameter controls the thickness of the line that

plot()

generates

1

. Once a plot has been generated, there are many methods

available to modify the plot before it's presented. The

set_title()

method

sets an overall title for the chart

2

. The

fontsize

parameters, which appear

repeatedly throughout the code, control the size of the text in various ele-  
ments on the chart.

The

set_xlabel()

and

set_ylabel()

methods allow you to set a title for each

of the axes

3

, and the method

tick_params()

styles the tick marks

4

. Here

tick_params()

sets the font size of the tick mark labels to 14 on both axes.

As you can see in Figure 15-2, the resulting chart is much easier to read.

The label type is bigger, and the line graph is thicker. It's often worth experi-  
menting with these values to see what works best in the resulting graph.

*Figure 15-2: The chart is much easier to read now.*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress343.png)

**305**

***Correcting the Plot***

Now that we can read the chart better, we can see that the data is not plot-  
ted correctly. Notice at the end of the graph that the square of 4.0 is shown   
as 25! Let's fix that.

When you give

plot()

a single sequence of numbers, it assumes the first

data point corresponds to an *x* -value of 0, but our first point corresponds to   
an *x*-value of 1. We can override the default behavior by giving

plot()

both

the input and output values used to calculate the squares:

*mpl_squares.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

input_values = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]

squares = \[1, 4, 9, 16, 25\]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(input_values, squares, linewidth=3)

# Set chart title and label axes.

*--snip--*

Now

plot()

doesn't have to make any assumptions about how the out-

put numbers were generated. The resulting plot, shown in Figure 15-3, is   
correct.

*Figure 15-3: The data is now plotted correctly.*

You can specify a number of arguments when calling

plot()

and use a

number of methods to customize your plots after generating them. We'll   
continue to explore these approaches to customization as we work with   
more interesting datasets throughout this chapter.

Chapter 15

***Using Built-in Styles***

Matplotlib has a number of predefined styles available. These styles contain   
a variety of default settings for background colors, gridlines, line widths,   
fonts, font sizes, and more. They can make your visualizations appealing   
without requiring much customization. To see the full list of available styles,   
run the following lines in a terminal session:

\>\>\>

**import matplotlib.pyplot as plt**

\>\>\>

**plt.style.available**

\['Solarize_Light2', '_classic_test_patch', '_mpl-gallery',

*--snip--*

To use any of these styles, add one line of code before calling

subplots()

:

*mpl_squares.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

input_values = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]  
squares = \[1, 4, 9, 16, 25\]

plt.style.use('seaborn')

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

*--snip--*

This code generates the plot shown in Figure 15-4. A wide variety of

styles is available; play around with these styles to find some that you like.

*Figure 15-4: The built-in seaborn style*

***Plotting and Styling Individual Points with scatter()***

Sometimes, it's useful to plot and style individual points based on certain   
characteristics. For example, you might plot small values in one color and   
larger values in a different color. You could also plot a large dataset with   
one set of styling options and then emphasize individual points by replot-  
ting them with different options.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress345.png)

Generating Data

**307**

To plot a single point, pass the single *x* - and *y*-values of the point to

scatter()

:

*scatter*

*_squares.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.style.use('seaborn')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()  
ax.scatter(2, 4)

plt.show()

Let's style the output to make it more interesting. We'll add a title, label

the axes, and make sure all the text is large enough to read:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.style.use('seaborn')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

1

ax.scatter(2, 4, s=200)

# Set chart title and label axes.  
ax.set_title("Square Numbers", fontsize=24)  
ax.set_xlabel("Value", fontsize=14)  
ax.set_ylabel("Square of Value", fontsize=14)

# Set size of tick labels.  
ax.tick_params(labelsize=14)

plt.show()

We call

scatter()

and use the

s

argument to set the size of the dots used

to draw the graph

1

. When you run *scatter_squares.py*now, you should see a

single point in the middle of the chart, as shown in Figure 15-5.

*Figure 15-5: Plotting a single point*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress346.png)

**308**

Chapter 15

***Plotting a Series of Points with scatter()***

To plot a series of points, we can pass

scatter()

separate lists of *x*- and

*y*-values, like this:

*scatter*

*_squares.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x_values = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]  
y_values = \[1, 4, 9, 16, 25\]

plt.style.use('seaborn')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.scatter(x_values, y_values, s=100)

# Set chart title and label axes.

*--snip--*

The

x_values

list contains the numbers to be squared, and

y_values

contains

the square of each number. When these lists are passed to

scatter()

, Matplotlib

reads one value from each list as it plots each point. The points to be plotted   
are (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), and (5, 25); Figure 15-6 shows the result.

*Figure 15-6: A scatter plot with multiple points*

***Calculating Data Automatically***

Writing lists by hand can be inefficient, especially when we have many   
points. Rather than writing out each value, let's use a loop to do the cal-  
culations for us.

Here's how this would look with 1,000 points:

*scatter*

*_squares.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

1

x_values = range(1, 1001)

y_values = \[x\*\*2 for x in x_values\]  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress347.png)

Generating Data

**309**

plt.style.use('seaborn')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

2

ax.scatter(x_values, y_values, s=10)

# Set chart title and label axes.

*--snip--*

# Set the range for each axis.

3

ax.axis(\[0, 1100, 0, 1_100_000\])

plt.show()

We start with a range of *x*-values containing the numbers 1 through

1,000

1

. Next, a list comprehension generates the *y*-values by looping

through the *x*-values (

for x in x_values

), squaring each number (

x\*\*2

), and

assigning the results to

y_values

. We then pass the input and output lists to

scatter()

2

. Because this is a large dataset, we use a smaller point size.

Before showing the plot, we use the

axis()

method to specify the

range of each axis

3

. The

axis()

method requires four values: the mini-

mum and maximum values for the *x* -axis and the *y* -axis. Here, we run   
the *x* -axis from 0 to 1,100 and the *y* -axis from 0 to 1,100,000. Figure 15-7   
shows the result.

*Figure 15-7: Python can plot 1,000 points as easily as it plots 5 points.*

***Customizing Tick Labels***

When the numbers on an axis get large enough, Matplotlib defaults to   
scientific notation for tick labels. This is usually a good thing, because   
larger numbers in plain notation take up a lot of unnecessary space on a   
visualization.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress348.png)

**310**

Chapter 15

Almost every element of a chart is customizable, so you can tell Matplotlib

to keep using plain notation if you prefer:

*--snip--*

# Set the range for each axis.  
ax.axis(\[0, 1100, 0, 1_100_000\])

ax.ticklabel_format(style='plain')

plt.show()

The

ticklabel_format()

method allows you to override the default tick

label style for any plot.

***Defining Custom Colors***

To change the color of the points, pass the argument

color

to

scatter()

with

the name of a color to use in quotation marks, as shown here:

ax.scatter(x_values, y_values, color='red', s=10)

You can also define custom colors using the RGB color model. To

define a color, pass the

color

argument a tuple with three float values (one

each for red, green, and blue, in that order), using values between 0 and 1.   
For example, the following line creates a plot with light-green dots:

ax.scatter(x_values, y_values, color=(0, 0.8, 0), s=10)

Values closer to 0 produce darker colors, and values closer to 1 produce

lighter colors.

***Using a Colormap***

A *colormap* is a sequence of colors in a gradient that moves from a starting   
to an ending color. In visualizations, colormaps are used to emphasize pat-  
terns in data. For example, you might make low values a light color and   
high values a darker color. Using a colormap ensures that all points in the   
visualization vary smoothly and accurately along a well-designed color scale.

The

pyplot

module includes a set of built-in colormaps. To use one of

these colormaps, you need to specify how

pyplot

should assign a color to

each point in the dataset. Here's how to assign a color to each point, based   
on its *y*-value:

*scatter*

*_squares.py*

*--snip--*

plt.style.use('seaborn')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.scatter(x_values, y_values, c=y_values, cmap=plt.cm.Blues, s=10)

# Set chart title and label axes.

*--snip--*

The

c

argument is similar to

color

, but it's used to associate a sequence

of values with a color mapping. We pass the list of *y*-values to

c

, and then  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress349.png)

Generating Data

**311**

tell

pyplot

which colormap to use with the

cmap

argument. This code colors

the points with lower *y* -values light blue and the points with higher *y* -values   
dark blue. Figure 15-8 shows the resulting plot.

*Tutorials, scroll down to Colors, and click **Choosing Colormaps in Matplotlib**.*

*Figure 15-8: A plot using the*

***Saving Your Plots Automatically***

If you want to save the plot to a file instead of showing it in the Matplotlib   
viewer, you can use

plt.savefig()

instead of

plt.show()

:

plt.savefig('squares_plot.png', bbox_inches='tight')

The first argument is a filename for the plot image, which will be saved

in the same directory as *scatter_squares.py* . The second argument trims extra   
whitespace from the plot. If you want the extra whitespace around the plot,   
you can omit this argument. You can also call

savefig()

with a

Path

object,

and write the output file anywhere you want on your system.

Chapter 15

**Random Walks**

In this section, we'll use Python to generate data for a random walk and   
then use Matplotlib to create a visually appealing representation of that   
data. A *random walk* is a path that's determined by a series of simple deci-  
sions, each of which is left entirely to chance. You might imagine a random   
walk as the path a confused ant would take if it took every step in a ran-  
dom direction.

Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology,

chemistry, and economics. For example, a pollen grain floating on a drop   
of water moves across the surface of the water because it's constantly pushed   
around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is random,   
so the path a pollen grain traces on the surface is a random walk. The code   
we'll write next models many real-world situations.

***Creating the RandomWalk Class***

To create a random walk, we'll create a

RandomWalk

class, which will make ran-

dom decisions about which direction the walk should take. The class needs   
three attributes: one variable to track the number of points in the walk, and   
two lists to store the *x* - and *y*-coordinates of each point in the walk.

We'll only need two methods for the

RandomWalk

class: the

__init__()

method and

fill_walk()

, which will calculate the points in the walk. Let's

start with the

__init__()

method:

*random*

*_walk.py*

1

from random import choice

class RandomWalk:  
"""A class to generate random walks."""

2

def __init__(self, num_points=5000):

"""Initialize attributes of a walk."""  
self.num_points = num_points

# All walks start at (0, 0).

3

self.x_values = \[0\]

self.y_values = \[0\]

To make random decisions, we'll store possible moves in a list and use

the

choice()

function (from the

random

module) to decide which move to

make each time a step is taken

1

. We set the default number of points in

a walk to

5000

, which is large enough to generate some interesting patterns

but small enough to generate walks quickly

2

. Then we make two lists to

hold the *x* - and *y*-values, and we start each walk at the point (0, 0)

3

.

***Choosing Directions***

We'll use the

fill_walk()

method to determine the full sequence of points

in the walk. Add this method to *random_walk.py*:

*random*

*_walk.py*

def fill_walk(self):  
"""Calculate all the points in the walk."""  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress351.png)

Generating Data

**313**

# Keep taking steps until the walk reaches the desired length.

1

while len(self.x_values) \< self.num_points:

# Decide which direction to go, and how far to go.

2

x_direction = choice(\[1, -1\])

x_distance = choice(\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\])

3

x_step = x_direction \* x_distance

y_direction = choice(\[1, -1\])  
y_distance = choice(\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\])

4

y_step = y_direction \* y_distance

# Reject moves that go nowhere.

5

if x_step == 0 and y_step == 0:

continue

# Calculate the new position.

6

x = self.x_values\[-1\] + x_step

y = self.y_values\[-1\] + y_step

self.x_values.append(x)  
self.y_values.append(y)

We first set up a loop that runs until the walk is filled with the correct

number of points

1

. The main part of

fill_walk()

tells Python how to simu-

late four random decisions: Will the walk go right or left? How far will it go   
in that direction? Will it go up or down? How far will it go in that direction?

We use

choice(\[1, -1\])

to choose a value for

x_direction

, which returns

either 1 for movement to the right or â1 for movement to the left

2

. Next,

choice(\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\])

randomly selects a distance to move in that direc-

tion. We assign this value to

x_distance

. The inclusion of a 0 allows for the

possibility of steps that have movement along only one axis.

We determine the length of each step in the *x-* and *y-*directions by mul-

tiplying the direction of movement by the distance chosen

3

4

. A positive

result for

x_step

means move to the right, a negative result means move

to the left, and 0 means move vertically. A positive result for

y_step

means

move up, negative means move down, and 0 means move horizontally. If the   
values of both

x_step

and

y_step

are 0, the walk doesn't go anywhere; when

this happens, we continue the loop

5

.

To get the next *x*-value for the walk, we add the value in

x_step

to the

last value stored in

x_values

6

and do the same for the *y*-values. When we

have the new point's coordinates, we append them to

x_values

and

y_values

.

***Plotting the Random Walk***

Here's the code to plot all the points in the walk:

*rw_visual.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from random_walk import RandomWalk

# Make a random walk.

Chapter 15

1

rw = RandomWalk()

rw.fill_walk()

# Plot the points in the walk.  
plt.style.use('classic')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

2

ax.scatter(rw.x_values, rw.y_values, s=15)

3

ax.set_aspect('equal')

plt.show()

We begin by importing

pyplot

and

RandomWalk

. We then create a random

walk and assign it to

rw

1

, making sure to call

fill_walk()

. To visualize the walk,

we feed the walk's *x* - and *y*-values to

scatter()

and choose an appropriate

dot size

2

. By default, Matplotlib scales each axis independently. But that

approach would stretch most walks out horizontally or vertically. Here we   
use the

set_aspect()

method to specify that both axes should have equal

spacing between tick marks

3

.

Figure 15-9 shows the resulting plot with 5,000 points. The images in

this section omit Matplotlib's viewer, but you'll continue to see it when you   
run *rw_visual.py*.

*Figure 15-9: A random walk with 5,000 points*

***Generating Multiple Random Walks***

Every random walk is different, and it's fun to explore the various patterns   
that can be generated. One way to use the preceding code to make multiple   
walks without having to run the program several times is to wrap it in a

while

loop, like this:

*rw_visual.py*

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from random_walk import RandomWalk

# Keep making new walks, as long as the program is active.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress353.png)

Generating Data

**315**

while True:

# Make a random walk.

*--snip--*

plt.show()

keep_running = input("Make another walk? (y/n): ")  
if keep_running == 'n':  
break

This code generates a random walk, displays it in Matplotlib's viewer,

and pauses with the viewer open. When you close the viewer, you'll be asked   
whether you want to generate another walk. If you generate a few walks,   
you should see some that stay near the starting point, some that wander   
off mostly in one direction, some that have thin sections connecting larger   
groups of points, and many other kinds of walks. When you want to end the   
program, press N.

***Styling the Walk***

In this section, we'll customize our plots to emphasize the important char-  
acteristics of each walk and deemphasize distracting elements. To do so, we   
identify the characteristics we want to emphasize, such as where the walk   
began, where it ended, and the path taken. Next, we identify the character-  
istics to deemphasize, such as tick marks and labels. The result should be   
a simple visual representation that clearly communicates the path taken in   
each random walk.

**Coloring the Points**

We'll use a colormap to show the order of the points in the walk, and   
remove the black outline from each dot so the color of the dots will be   
clearer. To color the points according to their position in the walk, we   
pass the

c

argument a list containing the position of each point. Because

the points are plotted in order, this list just contains the numbers from 0   
to 4,999:

*rw_visual.py*

*--snip--*

while True:  
# Make a random walk.  
rw = RandomWalk()  
rw.fill_walk()

# Plot the points in the walk.

plt.style.use('classic')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

1

point_numbers = range(rw.num_points)

ax.scatter(rw.x_values, rw.y_values, c=point_numbers, cmap=plt.cm.Blues,  
edgecolors='none', s=15)  

ax.set_aspect('equal')

plt.show()  

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress354.png)

**316**

Chapter 15

We use

range()

to generate a list of numbers equal to the number of

points in the walk

1

. We assign this list to

point_numbers

, which we'll use to

set the color of each point in the walk. We pass

point_numbers

to the

c

argu-

ment, use the

Blues

colormap, and then pass

edgecolors='none'

to get rid of

the black outline around each point. The result is a plot that varies from   
light to dark blue, showing exactly how the walk moves from its starting   
point to its ending point. This is shown in Figure 15-10.

*Figure 15-10: A random walk colored with the*

*Blues*

*colormap*

**Plotting the Starting and Ending Points**

In addition to coloring points to show their position along the walk, it   
would be useful to see exactly where each walk begins and ends. To do so,   
we can plot the first and last points individually after the main series has   
been plotted. We'll make the end points larger and color them differently   
to make them stand out:

*rw_visual.py*

*--snip--*

while True:  

*--snip--*

ax.scatter(rw.x_values, rw.y_values, c=point_numbers, cmap=plt.cm.Blues,  
edgecolors='none', s=15)  
ax.set_aspect('equal')

# Emphasize the first and last points.  
ax.scatter(0, 0, c='green', edgecolors='none', s=100)  
ax.scatter(rw.x_values\[-1\], rw.y_values\[-1\], c='red', edgecolors='none',  
s=100)

plt.show()  

*--snip--*

To show the starting point, we plot the point (0, 0) in green and in a

larger size (

s=100

) than the rest of the points. To mark the end point, we  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress355.png)

Generating Data

**317**

plot the last *x* - and *y* -values in red with a size of 100 as well. Make sure you   
insert this code just before the call to

plt.show()

so the starting and ending

points are drawn on top of all the other points.

When you run this code, you should be able to spot exactly where each

walk begins and ends. If these end points don't stand out clearly enough,   
adjust their color and size until they do.

**Cleaning Up the Axes**

Let's remove the axes in this plot so they don't distract from the path of   
each walk. Here's how to hide the axes:

*rw_visual.py*

*--snip--*

while True:  

*--snip--*

ax.scatter(rw.x_values\[-1\], rw.y_values\[-1\], c='red', edgecolors='none',  
s=100)

# Remove the axes.  
ax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)  
ax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)

plt.show()  

*--snip--*

To modify the axes, we use the

ax.get_xaxis()

and

ax.get_yaxis()

meth-

ods to get each axis, and then chain the

set_visible()

method to make

each axis invisible. As you continue to work with visualizations, you'll fre-  
quently see this chaining of methods to customize different aspects of a   
visualization.

Run *rw_visual.py* now; you should see a series of plots with no axes.

**Adding Plot Points**

Let's increase the number of points, to give us more data to work with.   
To do so, we increase the value of

num_points

when we make a

RandomWalk

instance and adjust the size of each dot when drawing the plot:

*rw_visual.py*

*--snip--*

while True:  
# Make a random walk.

rw = RandomWalk(50_000)

rw.fill_walk()

# Plot the points in the walk.  
plt.style.use('classic')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()  
point_numbers = range(rw.num_points)  

ax.scatter(rw.x_values, rw.y_values, c=point_numbers, cmap=plt.cm.Blues,

edgecolors='none', s=1)

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress356.png)

**318**

Chapter 15

This example creates a random walk with 50,000 points and plots each

point at size

s=1

. The resulting walk is wispy and cloudlike, as shown in

Figure 15-11. We've created a piece of art from a simple scatter plot!

Experiment with this code to see how much you can increase the num-

ber of points in a walk before your system starts to slow down significantly   
or the plot loses its visual appeal.

*Figure 15-11: A walk with 50,000 points*

**Altering the Size to Fill the Screen**

A visualization is much more effective at communicating patterns in data   
if it fits nicely on the screen. To make the plotting window better fit your   
screen, you can adjust the size of Matplotlib's output. This is done in the

subplots()

call:

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 9))

When creating a plot, you can pass

subplots()

a

figsize

argument, which

sets the size of the figure. The

figsize

parameter takes a tuple that tells

Matplotlib the dimensions of the plotting window in inches.

Matplotlib assumes your screen resolution is 100 pixels per inch; if this

code doesn't give you an accurate plot size, adjust the numbers as necessary.   
Or, if you know your system's resolution, you can pass

subplots()

the resolu-

tion using the

dpi

parameter:

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6), dpi=128)

This should help make the most efficient use of the space available on

your screen.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**15-3. Molecular Motion:**

Modify

*rw_visual.py*

by replacing

ax.scatter()

with

ax.plot()

. To simulate the path of a pollen grain on the surface of a drop of

water, pass in the

rw.x_values

and

rw.y_values

, and include a

linewidth

argu-

ment. Use 5,000 instead of 50,000 points to keep the plot from being too busy.

**15-4. Modified Random Walks:**

In the

RandomWalk

class,

x_step

and

y_step

are

generated from the same set of conditions. The direction is chosen randomly   
from the list

\[1, -1\]

and the distance from the list

\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\]

. Modify the

values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks. Try   
a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the â1   
from the

*x-*

or

*y*

-direction list.

**15-5. Refactoring:**

The

fill_walk()

method is lengthy. Create a new method

called

get_step()

to determine the direction and distance for each step, and then

calculate the step. You should end up with two calls to

get_step()

in

fill_walk()

:

x_step = self.get_step()  
y_step = self.get_step()

This refactoring should reduce the size of

fill_walk()

and make the

method easier to read and understand.

**Rolling Dice with Plotly**

In this section, we'll use Plotly to produce interactive visualizations. Plotly is   
particularly useful when you're creating visualizations that will be displayed   
in a browser, because the visualizations will scale automatically to fit the   
viewer's screen. These visualizations are also interactive; when the user hov-  
ers over certain elements on the screen, information about those elements   
is highlighted. We'll build our initial visualization in just a couple lines of   
code using *Plotly Express* , a subset of Plotly that focuses on generating plots   
with as little code as possible. Once we know our plot is correct, we'll cus-  
tomize the output just as we did with Matplotlib.

In this project, we'll analyze the results of rolling dice. When you roll

one regular, six-sided die, you have an equal chance of rolling any of the   
numbers from 1 through 6. However, when you use two dice, you're more   
likely to roll certain numbers than others. We'll try to determine which   
numbers are most likely to occur by generating a dataset that represents   
rolling dice. Then we'll plot the results of a large number of rolls to deter-  
mine which results are more likely than others.

This work helps model games involving dice, but the core ideas also apply

to games that involve chance of any kind, such as card games. It also relates to   
many real-world situations where randomness plays a significant factor.

Chapter 15

***Installing Plotly***

Install Plotly using pip, just as you did for Matplotlib:

$

**python -m pip install --user plotly**

$

**python -m pip install --user pandas**

Plotly Express depends on *pandas*, which is a library for working effi-

ciently with data, so we need to install that as well. If you used

**python3**

or

something else when installing Matplotlib, make sure you use the same   
command here.

To see what kind of visualizations are possible with Plotly, visit the gal-

lery of chart types a[t *https://plotly.com/python*. E](https://plotly.com/python)ach example includes source   
code, so you can see how Plotly generates the visualizations.

***Creating the Die Class***

We'll create the following

Die

class to simulate the roll of one die:

*die.py*

from random import randint

class Die:  
"""A class representing a single die."""

1

def __init__(self, num_sides=6):

"""Assume a six-sided die."""  
self.num_sides = num_sides

def roll(self):  
""""Return a random value between 1 and number of sides."""

2

return randint(1, self.num_sides)

The

__init__()

method takes one optional argument

1

. With the

Die

class, when an instance of our die is created, the number of sides will be six   
if no argument is included. If an argument *is* included, that value will set   
the number of sides on the die. (Dice are named for their number of sides:   
a six-sided die is a D6, an eight-sided die is a D8, and so on.)

The

roll()

method uses the

randint()

function to return a random number

between 1 and the number of sides

2

. This function can return the starting

value (1), the ending value (

num_sides

), or any integer between the two.

***Rolling the Die***

Before creating a visualization based on the

Die

class, let's roll a D6, print

the results, and check that the results look reasonable:

*die_visual.py*

from die import Die

# Create a D6.

1

die = Die()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress359.png)

Generating Data

**321**

# Make some rolls, and store results in a list.  
results = \[\]

2

for roll_num in range(100):

result = die.roll()  
results.append(result)

print(results)

We create an instance of

Die

with the default six sides

1

. Then we

roll the die

100

times

2

and store the result of each roll in the list

results

.

Here's a sample set of results:

\[4, 6, 5, 6, 1, 5, 6, 3, 5, 3, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 3, 6, 3, 6, 5, 4,  
1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 6, 4, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 4,  
3, 5, 1, 4, 5, 5, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 2, 5, 6, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6,  
5, 5, 2, 2, 6, 4, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4,  
1, 5, 1, 2\]

A quick scan of these results shows that the

Die

class seems to be work-

ing. We see the values 1 and 6, so we know the smallest and largest possible   
values are being returned, and because we don't see 0 or 7, we know all   
the results are in the appropriate range. We also see each number from 1   
through 6, which indicates that all possible outcomes are represented. Let's   
determine exactly how many times each number appears.

***Analyzing the Results***

We'll analyze the results of rolling one D6 by counting how many times we   
roll each number:

*die_visual.py*

*--snip--*

# Make some rolls, and store results in a list.  
results = \[\]

1

for roll_num in range(1000):

result = die.roll()  
results.append(result)

# Analyze the results.  
frequencies = \[\]

2

poss_results = range(1, die.num_sides+1)

for value in poss_results:

3

frequency = results.count(value)

4

frequencies.append(frequency)

print(frequencies)

Because we're no longer printing the results, we can increase the num-

ber of simulated rolls to

1000

1

. To analyze the rolls, we create the empty

list

frequencies

to store the number of times each value is rolled. We then

generate all the possible results we could get; in this example, that's all the   
numbers from

1

to however many sides

die

has

2

. We loop through the pos-

sible values, count how many times each number appears in

results

3

, and  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress360.png)

**322**

Chapter 15

then append this value to

frequencies

4

. We print this list before making a

visualization:

\[155, 167, 168, 170, 159, 181\]

These results look reasonable: we see six frequencies, one for each possi-

ble number when you roll a D6. We also see that no frequency is significantly   
higher than any other. Now let's visualize these results.

***Making a Histogram***

Now that we have the data we want, we can generate a visualization in just a   
couple lines of code using Plotly Express:

*die_visual.py*

import plotly.express as px

from die import Die

*--snip--*

for value in poss_results:  
frequency = results.count(value)  
frequencies.append(frequency)

# Visualize the results.  
fig = px.bar(x=poss_results, y=frequencies)  
fig.show()

We first import the

plotly.express

module, using the conventional alias

px

. We then use the

px.bar()

function to create a bar graph. In the simplest

use of this function, we only need to pass a set of *x-* values and a set of *y-* values.   
Here the *x* -values are the possible results from rolling a single die, and the   
*y*-values are the frequencies for each possible result.

The final line calls

fig.show()

, which tells Plotly to render the resulting

chart as an HTML file and open that file in a new browser tab. The result is   
shown in Figure 15-12.

This is a really simple chart, and it's certainly not complete. But this

is exactly how Plotly Express is meant to be used; you write a couple lines   
of code, look at the plot, and make sure it represents the data the way you   
want it to. If you like what you see, you can move on to customizing ele-  
ments of the chart such as labels and styles. But if you want to explore other   
possible chart types, you can do so now, without having spent extra time on   
customization work. Feel free to try this now by changing

px.bar()

to some-

thing like

px.scatter()

or

px.line()

. You can find a full list of available chart

types a[t *https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express*](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express).

This chart is dynamic and interactive. If you change the size of your

browser window, the chart will resize to match the available space. If you   
hover over any of the bars, you'll see a pop-up highlighting the specific data   
related to that bar.

***Customizing the Plot***

Now that we know we have the correct kind of plot and our data is being   
represented accurately, we can focus on adding the appropriate labels and   
styles for the chart.

The first way to customize a plot with Plotly is to use some optional

parameters in the initial call that generates the plot, in this case,

px.bar()

.

Here's how to add an overall title and a label for each axis:

*die_visual.py*

*--snip--*

# Visualize the results.

1

title = "Results of Rolling One D6 1,000 Times"

2

labels = {'x': 'Result', 'y': 'Frequency of Result'}

fig = px.bar(x=poss_results, y=frequencies, title=title, labels=labels)

fig.show()

We first define the title that we want, here assigned to

title

1

. To

define axis labels, we write a dictionary

2

. The keys in the dictionary refer

to the labels we want to customize, and the values are the custom labels we   
want to use. Here we give the *x*-axis the label

Result

and the *y*-axis the label

Frequency of Result

. The call to

px.bar()

now includes the optional argu-

ments

title

and

labels

.

Now when the plot is generated it includes an appropriate title and a

label for each axis, as shown in Figure 15-13.

Chapter 15

*Figure 15-13: A simple bar chart created with Plotly*

***Rolling Two Dice***

Rolling two dice results in larger numbers and a different distribution of   
results. Let's modify our code to create two D6 dice to simulate the way we   
roll a pair of dice. Each time we roll the pair, we'll add the two numbers (one   
from each die) and store the sum in

results

. Save a copy of *die_visual.py* as

*dice_visual.py* and make the following changes:

*dice_visual.py*

import plotly.express as px

from die import Die

# Create two D6 dice.  
die_1 = Die()  
die_2 = Die()

# Make some rolls, and store results in a list.  
results = \[\]  
for roll_num in range(1000):

1

result = die_1.roll() + die_2.roll()

results.append(result)

# Analyze the results.  
frequencies = \[\]

2

max_result = die_1.num_sides + die_2.num_sides

3

poss_results = range(2, max_result+1)

for value in poss_results:  
frequency = results.count(value)  
frequencies.append(frequency)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress363.png)

Generating Data

**325**

# Visualize the results.

title = "Results of Rolling Two D6 Dice 1,000 Times"

labels = {'x': 'Result', 'y': 'Frequency of Result'}  
fig = px.bar(x=poss_results, y=frequencies, title=title, labels=labels)  
fig.show()

After creating two instances of

Die

, we roll the dice and calculate the sum

of the two dice for each roll

1

. The smallest possible result (2) is the sum of

the smallest number on each die. The largest possible result (12) is the sum   
of the largest number on each die, which we assign to

max_result

2

. The

variable

max_result

makes the code for generating

poss_results

much easier

to read

3

. We could have written

range(2, 13)

, but this would work only

for two D6 dice. When modeling real-world situations, it's best to write code   
that can easily model a variety of situations. This code allows us to simu-  
late rolling a pair of dice with any number of sides.

After running this code, you should see a chart that looks like Figure 15-14.

*Figure 15-14: Simulated results of rolling two six-sided dice 1,000 times*

This graph shows the approximate distribution of results you're likely to

get when you roll a pair of D6 dice. As you can see, you're least likely to roll   
a 2 or a 12 and most likely to roll a 7. This happens because there are six   
ways to roll a 7: 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4, 4 and 3, 5 and 2, and 6 and 1.

***Further Customizations***

There's one issue that we should address with the plot we just generated.   
Now that there are 11 bars, the default layout settings for the *x* -axis leave   
some of the bars unlabeled. While the default settings work well for most   
visualizations, this chart would look better with all of the bars labeled.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress364.png)

**326**

Chapter 15

Plotly has an

update_layout()

method that can be used to make a wide

variety of updates to a figure after it's been created. Here's how to tell Plotly   
to give each bar its own label:

*dice_visual.py*

*--snip--*

fig = px.bar(x=poss_results, y=frequencies, title=title, labels=labels)

# Further customize chart.  
fig.update_layout(xaxis_dtick=1)

fig.show()

The

update_layout()

method acts on the

fig

object, which represents the

overall chart. Here we use the

xaxis_dtick

argument, which specifies the

distance between tick marks on the *x*-axis. We set that spacing to

1

, so that

every bar is labeled. When you run *dice_visual.py* again, you should see a   
label on each bar.

***Rolling Dice of Different Sizes***

Let's create a six-sided die and a ten-sided die, and see what happens when   
we roll them 50,000 times:

*dice_visual*

*_d6d10.py*

import plotly.express as px

from die import Die

# Create a D6 and a D10.

die_1 = Die()

1

die_2 = Die(10)

# Make some rolls, and store results in a list.  
results = \[\]

for roll_num in range(50_000):

result = die_1.roll() + die_2.roll()  
results.append(result)

# Analyze the results.

*--snip--*

# Visualize the results.

2

title = "Results of Rolling a D6 and a D10 50,000 Times"

labels = {'x': 'Result', 'y': 'Frequency of Result'}

*--snip--*

To make a D10, we pass the argument

10

when creating the second

Die

instance

1

and change the first loop to simulate 50,000 rolls instead of

1,000. We change the title of the graph as well

2

Generating Data

**327**

Figure 15-15 shows the resulting chart. Instead of one most likely result,

there are five such results. This happens because there's still only one way   
to roll the smallest value (1 and 1) and the largest value (6 and 10), but the   
smaller die limits the number of ways you can generate the middle numbers.   
There are six ways to roll a 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11, these are the most common   
results, and you're equally likely to roll any one of them.

*Figure 15-15: The results of rolling a six-sided die and a ten-sided die 50,000 times*

Our ability to use Plotly to model the rolling of dice gives us considerable

freedom in exploring this phenomenon. In just minutes, you can simulate a   
tremendous number of rolls using a large variety of dice.

***Saving Figures***

When you have a figure you like, you can always save the chart as an HTML   
file through your browser. But you can also do so programmatically. To save   
your chart as an HTML file, replace the call to

fig.show()

with a call to

fig

.write_html()

:

fig.write_html('dice_visual_d6d10.html')

The

write_html()

method requires one argument: the name of the file

to write to. If you only provide a filename, the file will be saved in the same   
directory as the *.py* file. You can also call

write_html()

with a

Path

object, and

write the output file anywhere you want on your system.

Chapter 15

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**15-6. Two D8s:**

Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two

eight-sided dice 1,000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization will   
look like before you run the simulation, then see if your intuition was correct.   
Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see the limits of your   
system's capabilities.

**15-7. Three Dice:**

When you roll three D6 dice, the smallest number you can roll

is 3 and the largest number is 18. Create a visualization that shows what hap-  
pens when you roll three D6 dice.

**15-8. Multiplication:**

When you roll two dice, you usually add the two numbers

together to get the result. Create a visualization that shows what happens if you   
multiply these numbers by each other instead.

**15-9. Die Comprehensions:**

For clarity, the listings in this section use the long

form of

for

loops. If you're comfortable using list comprehensions, try writing a

comprehension for one or both of the loops in each of these programs.

**15-10. Practicing with Both Libraries:**

Try using Matplotlib to make a die-rolling

visualization, and use Plotly to make the visualization for a random walk. (You'll   
need to consult the documentation for each library to complete this exercise.)

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned to generate datasets and create visualizations   
of that data. You created simple plots with Matplotlib and used a scatter   
plot to explore random walks. You also created a histogram with Plotly, and   
used it to explore the results of rolling dice of different sizes.

Generating your own datasets with code is an interesting and power-

ful way to model and explore a wide variety of real-world situations. As you   
continue to work through the data visualization projects that follow, keep   
an eye out for situations you might be able to model with code. Look at the   
visualizations you see in news media, and see if you can identify those that   
were generated using methods similar to the ones you're learning in these   
projects.

In [Chapter 16](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#367), you'll download data from online sources and continue

to use Matplotlib and Plotly to explore that data.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress367.png)

**D O W N L O A D I N G D A T A**

In this chapter, you'll download datasets

from online sources and create working

visualizations of that data. You can find

an incredible variety of data online, much of

which hasn't been examined thoroughly. The ability   
to analyze this data allows you to discover patterns   
and connections that no one else has found.

We'll access and visualize data stored in two common data formats:

CSV and JSON. We'll use Python's

csv

module to process weather data

stored in the CSV format and analyze high and low temperatures over time   
in two different locations. We'll then use Matplotlib to generate a chart   
based on our downloaded data to display variations in temperature in two   
dissimilar environments: Sitka, Alaska, and Death Valley, California. Later   
in the chapter, we'll use the

json

module to access earthquake data stored

in the GeoJSON format and use Plotly to draw a world map showing the   
locations and magnitudes of recent earthquakes.

Chapter 16

By the end of this chapter, you'll be prepared to work with various types

of datasets in different formats, and you'll have a deeper understanding of   
how to build complex visualizations. Being able to access and visualize   
online data is essential to working with a wide variety of real-world datasets.

**The CSV File Format**

One simple way to store data in a text file is to write the data as a series of   
values separated by commas, called *comma-separated values* . The resulting files   
are *CSV* files. For example, here's a chunk of weather data in CSV format:

"USW00025333","SITKA AIRPORT, AK US","2021-01-01",,"44","40"

This is an excerpt of weather data from January 1, 2021, in Sitka, Alaska.

It includes the day's high and low temperatures, as well as a number of other   
measurements from that day. CSV files can be tedious for humans to read,   
but programs can process and extract information from them quickly and   
accurately.

We'll begin with a small set of CSV-formatted weather data recorded

in Sitka; it is available in this book's resources at [*https://ehmatthes.github.io/
pcc_3e*. M](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e)ake a folder called *weather_data* inside the folder where you're sav-  
ing this chapter's programs. Copy the file *sitka_weather_07-2021_simple.csv*   
into this new folder. (After you download this book's resources, you'll have   
all the files you need for this project.)

**N O T E**

*The weather data in this project was originally downloaded from* [https://ncdc](https://ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web)

[.noaa.gov/cdo-web](https://ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web)*.*

***Parsing the CSV File Headers***

Python's

csv

module in the standard library parses the lines in a CSV file

and allows us to quickly extract the values we're interested in. Let's start by   
examining the first line of the file, which contains a series of headers for   
the data. These headers tell us what kind of information the data holds:

*sitka_highs.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import csv

1

path = Path('weather_data/sitka_weather_07-2021_simple.csv')

lines = path.read_text().splitlines()

2

reader = csv.reader(lines)

3

header_row = next(reader)

print(header_row)

We first import

Path

and the

csv

module. We then build a

Path

object

that looks in the *weather_data* folder, and points to the specific weather data   
file we want to work with

1

. We read the file and chain the

splitlines()

method to get a list of all lines in the file, which we assign to

lines

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress369.png)

Downloading Data

**331**

Next, we build a

reader

object

2

. This is an object that can be used

to parse each line in the file. To make a reader object, call the function

csv.reader()

and pass it the list of lines from the CSV file.

When given a

reader

object, the

next()

function returns the next line

in the file, starting from the beginning of the file. Here we call

next()

only

once, so we get the first line of the file, which contains the file headers

3

.

We assign the data that's returned to

header_row

. As you can see,

header_row

contains meaningful, weather-related headers that tell us what information   
each line of data holds:

\['STATION', 'NAME', 'DATE', 'TAVG', 'TMAX', 'TMIN'\]

The

reader

object processes the first line of comma-separated values in

the file and stores each value as an item in a list. The header

STATION

repre-

sents the code for the weather station that recorded this data. The position   
of this header tells us that the first value in each line will be the weather   
station code. The

NAME

header indicates that the second value in each line

is the name of the weather station that made the recording. The rest of   
the headers specify what kinds of information were recorded in each read-  
ing. The data we're most interested in for now are the date (

DATE

), the high

temperature (

TMAX

), and the low temperature (

TMIN

). This is a simple dataset

that contains only temperature-related data. When you download your own   
weather data, you can choose to include a number of other measurements   
relating to wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation data.

***Printing the Headers and Their Positions***

To make it easier to understand the file header data, let's print each header   
and its position in the list:

*sitka_highs.py*

*--snip--*

reader = csv.reader(lines)  
header_row = next(reader)

for index, column_header in enumerate(header_row):  
print(index, column_header)

The

enumerate()

function returns both the index of each item and the

value of each item as you loop through a list. (Note that we've removed the   
line

print(header_row)

in favor of this more detailed version.)

Here's the output showing the index of each header:

0 STATION  
1 NAME  
2 DATE  
3 TAVG  
4 TMAX  
5 TMIN  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress370.png)

**332**

Chapter 16

We can see that the dates and their high temperatures are stored in col-

umns 2 and 4. To explore this data, we'll process each row of data in *sitka
_weather_07-2021_simple.csv* and extract the values with the indexes 2 and 4.

***Extracting and Reading Data***

Now that we know which columns of data we need, let's read in some of that   
data. First, we'll read in the high temperature for each day:

*sitka_highs.py*

*--snip--*

reader = csv.reader(lines)  
header_row = next(reader)

# Extract high temperatures.

1

highs = \[\]

2

for row in reader:

3

high = int(row\[4\])

highs.append(high)

print(highs)

We make an empty list called

highs

1

and then loop through the

remaining rows in the file

2

. The

reader

object continues from where it left

off in the CSV file and automatically returns each line following its current   
position. Because we've already read the header row, the loop will begin   
at the second line where the actual data begins. On each pass through the   
loop we pull the data from index 4, corresponding to the header

TMAX

, and

assign it to the variable

high

3

. We use the

int()

function to convert the

data, which is stored as a string, to a numerical format so we can use it. We   
then append this value to

highs

.

The following listing shows the data now stored in

highs

:

\[61, 60, 66, 60, 65, 59, 58, 58, 57, 60, 60, 60, 57, 58, 60, 61, 63, 63, 70,  
64, 59, 63, 61, 58, 59, 64, 62, 70, 70, 73, 66\]

We've extracted the high temperature for each date and stored each

value in a list. Now let's create a visualization of this data.

***Plotting Data in a Temperature Chart***

To visualize the temperature data we have, we'll first create a simple plot of   
the daily highs using Matplotlib, as shown here:

*sitka_highs.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import csv

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

path = Path('weather_data/sitka_weather_07-2021_simple.csv')  
lines = path.read_text().splitlines()  

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress371.png)

Downloading Data

**333**

# Plot the high temperatures.  
plt.style.use('seaborn')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

1

ax.plot(highs, color='red')

# Format plot.

2

ax.set_title("Daily High Temperatures, July 2021", fontsize=24)

3

ax.set_xlabel('', fontsize=16)

ax.set_ylabel("Temperature (F)", fontsize=16)  
ax.tick_params(labelsize=16)

plt.show()

We pass the list of highs to

plot()

and pass

color='red'

to plot the points

in red

1

. (We'll plot the highs in red and the lows in blue.) We then specify

a few other formatting details, such as the title, font size, and labels

2

, just

as we did i[n Chapter 15](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#339). Because we have yet to add the dates, we won't   
label the *x*-axis, but

ax.set_xlabel()

does modify the font size to make

the default labels more readable

3

. Figure 16-1 shows the resulting plot: a

simple line graph of the high temperatures for July 2021 in Sitka, Alaska.

*Figure 16-1: A line graph showing daily high temperatures for July 2021*

*in Sitka, Alaska*

***The datetime Module***

Let's add dates to our graph to make it more useful. The first date from the   
weather data file is in the second row of the file:

"USW00025333","SITKA AIRPORT, AK US","2021-07-01",,"61","53"

The data will be read in as a string, so we need a way to convert the

string

"2021-07-01"

to an object representing this date. We can construct  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress372.png)

**334**

Chapter 16

an object representing July 1, 2021, using the

strptime()

method from the

datetime

module. Let's see how

strptime()

works in a terminal session:

\>\>\>

**from datetime import datetime**

\>\>\>

**first_date = datetime.strptime('2021-07-01', '%Y-%m-%d')**

\>\>\>

**print(first_date)**

2021-07-01 00:00:00

We first import the

datetime

class from the

datetime

module. Then we

call the method

strptime()

with the string containing the date we want to

process as its first argument. The second argument tells Python how the   
date is formatted. In this example,

'%Y-'

tells Python to look for a four-digit

year before the first dash;

'%m-'

indicates a two-digit month before the sec-

ond dash; and

'%d'

means the last part of the string is the day of the month,

from 1 to 31.

The

strptime()

method can take a variety of arguments to determine

how to interpret the date. Table 16-1 shows some of these arguments.

**Table 16-1:**

Date and Time Formatting Arguments from

the

datetime

Module

**Argument**

**Meaning**

%A

Weekday name, such as Monday

%B

Month name, such as January

%m

Month, as a number (01 to 12)

%d

Day of the month, as a number (01 to 31)

%Y

Four-digit year, such as 2019

%y

Two-digit year, such as 19

%H

Hour, in 24-hour format (00 to 23)

%I

Hour, in 12-hour format (01 to 12)

%p

AM or PM

%M

Minutes (00 to 59)

%S

Seconds (00 to 61)

***Plotting Dates***

We can improve our plot by extracting dates for the daily high temperature   
readings, and using these dates on the *x*-axis:

*sitka_highs.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import csv

from datetime import datetime

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

path = Path('weather_data/sitka_weather_07-2021_simple.csv')  
lines = path.read_text().splitlines()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress373.png)

Downloading Data

**335**

reader = csv.reader(lines)  
header_row = next(reader)

# Extract dates and high temperatures.

1

dates, highs = \[\], \[\]

for row in reader:

2

current_date = datetime.strptime(row\[2\], '%Y-%m-%d')

high = int(row\[4\])

dates.append(current_date)

highs.append(high)

# Plot the high temperatures.  
plt.style.use('seaborn')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

3

ax.plot(dates, highs, color='red')

# Format plot.  
ax.set_title("Daily High Temperatures, July 2021", fontsize=24)  
ax.set_xlabel('', fontsize=16)

4

fig.autofmt_xdate()

ax.set_ylabel("Temperature (F)", fontsize=16)  
ax.tick_params(labelsize=16)

plt.show()

We create two empty lists to store the dates and high temperatures

from the file

1

. We then convert the data containing the date information

(

row\[2\]

) to a

datetime

object

2

and append it to

dates

. We pass the dates and

the high temperature values to

plot()

3

. The call to

fig.autofmt_xdate()

4

draws the date labels diagonally to prevent them from overlapping. Figure 16-2   
shows the improved graph.

*Figure 16-2: The graph is more meaningful, now that it has dates on the*

x

*-axis.*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress374.png)

**336**

Chapter 16

***Plotting a Longer Timeframe***

With our graph set up, let's include additional data to get a more complete   
picture of the weather in Sitka. Copy the file *sitka_weather_2021_simple.csv* ,   
which contains a full year's worth of weather data for Sitka, to the folder   
where you're storing the data for this chapter's programs.

Now we can generate a graph for the entire year's weather:

*sitka_highs.py*

*--snip--*

path = Path('weather_data/sitka_weather_2021_simple.csv')

lines = path.read_text().splitlines()

*--snip--*

# Format plot.

ax.set_title("Daily High Temperatures, 2021", fontsize=24)

ax.set_xlabel('', fontsize=16)

*--snip--*

We modify the filename to use the new data file *sitka_weather_2021*

*_simple.csv* , and we update the title of our plot to reflect the change in its   
content. Figure 16-3 shows the resulting plot.

*Figure 16-3: A year's worth of data*

***Plotting a Second Data Series***

We can make our graph even more useful by including the low tempera-  
tures. We need to extract the low temperatures from the data file and then   
add them to our graph, as shown here:

*sitka*

*_highs_lows.py*

*--snip--*

reader = csv.reader(lines)  
header_row = next(reader)

# Extract dates, and high and low temperatures.

1

dates, highs, lows = \[\], \[\], \[\]

for row in reader:  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress375.png)

Downloading Data

**337**

current_date = datetime.strptime(row\[2\], '%Y-%m-%d')  
high = int(row\[4\])

2

low = int(row\[5\])

dates.append(current_date)  
highs.append(high)

lows.append(low)

# Plot the high and low temperatures.

plt.style.use('seaborn')  
fig, ax = plt.subplots()  
ax.plot(dates, highs, color='red')

3

ax.plot(dates, lows, color='blue')

# Format plot.

4

ax.set_title("Daily High and Low Temperatures, 2021", fontsize=24)

*--snip--*

We add the empty list

lows

to hold low temperatures

1

, and then we

extract and store the low temperature for each date from the sixth position   
in each row (

row\[5\]

)

2

. We add a call to

plot()

for the low temperatures and

color these values blue

3

. Finally, we update the title

4

. Figure 16-4 shows

the resulting chart.

*Figure 16-4: Two data series on the same plot*

***Shading an Area in the Chart***

Having added two data series, we can now examine the range of tempera-  
tures for each day. Let's add a finishing touch to the graph by using shading   
to show the range between each day's high and low temperatures. To do so,   
we'll use the

fill_between()

method, which takes a series of *x*-values and two

series of *y* -values and fills the space between the two series of *y*-values:

*sitka*

*_highs_lows.py*

*--snip--*

# Plot the high and low temperatures.  
plt.style.use('seaborn')  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress376.png)

**338**

Chapter 16

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

1

ax.plot(dates, highs, color='red', alpha=0.5)

ax.plot(dates, lows, color='blue', alpha=0.5)

2

ax.fill_between(dates, highs, lows, facecolor='blue', alpha=0.1)

*--snip--*

The

alpha

argument controls a color's transparency

1

. An

alpha

value

of 0 is completely transparent, and a value of 1 (the default) is completely   
opaque. By setting

alpha

to 0.5, we make the red and blue plot lines appear

lighter.

We pass

fill_between()

the list

dates

for the *x*-values and then the two

*y*-value series

highs

and

lows

2

. The

facecolor

argument determines the

color of the shaded region; we give it a low

alpha

value of 0.1 so the filled

region connects the two data series without distracting from the informa-  
tion they represent. Figure 16-5 shows the plot with the shaded region   
between the highs and lows.

*Figure 16-5: The region between the two datasets is shaded.*

The shading helps make the range between the two datasets immedi-

ately apparent.

***Error Checking***

We should be able to run the *sitka_highs_lows.py* code using data for any   
location. But some weather stations collect different data than others, and   
some occasionally malfunction and fail to collect some of the data they're   
supposed to. Missing data can result in exceptions that crash our programs,   
unless we handle them properly.

For example, let's see what happens when we attempt to generate a tem-

perature plot for Death Valley, California. Copy the file *death_valley_2021
_simple.csv* to the folder where you're storing the data for this chapter's   
programs.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress377.png)

Downloading Data

**339**

First, let's run the code to see the headers that are included in this

data file:

*death_valley*

*_highs_lows.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import csv

path = Path('weather_data/death_valley_2021_simple.csv')  
lines = path.read_text().splitlines()

reader = csv.reader(lines)  
header_row = next(reader)

for index, column_header in enumerate(header_row):  
print(index, column_header)

Here's the output:

0 STATION  
1 NAME  
2 DATE  
3 TMAX  
4 TMIN  
5 TOBS

The date is in the same position, at index 2. But the high and low tem-

peratures are at indexes 3 and 4, so we'll need to change the indexes in our   
code to reflect these new positions. Instead of including an average temper-  
ature reading for the day, this station includes

TOBS

, a reading for a specific

observation time.

Change *sitka_highs_lows.py* to generate a graph for Death Valley using

the indexes we just noted, and see what happens:

*death_valley*

*_highs_lows.py*

We update the program to read from the Death Valley data file, and we

change the indexes to correspond to this file's

TMAX

and

TMIN

positions.

When we run the program, we get an error:

Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "death_valley_highs_lows.py", line 17, in \<module\>  
high = int(row\[3\])

1

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''

**340**

Chapter 16

The traceback tells us that Python can't process the high temperature for

one of the dates because it can't turn an empty string (

''

) into an integer

1

.

Rather than looking through the data to find out which reading is missing,   
we'll just handle cases of missing data directly.

We'll run error-checking code when the values are being read from the

CSV file to handle exceptions that might arise. Here's how to do this:

*death_valley*

*_highs_lows.py*

*--snip--*

for row in reader:  
current_date = datetime.strptime(row\[2\], '%Y-%m-%d')

1

try:

high = int(row\[3\])  
low = int(row\[4\])

except ValueError:

2

print(f"Missing data for {current_date}")

3

else:

dates.append(current_date)  
highs.append(high)  
lows.append(low)

# Plot the high and low temperatures.

*--snip--*

# Format plot.

4

title = "Daily High and Low Temperatures, 2021\\nDeath Valley, CA"

ax.set_title(title, fontsize=20)

ax.set_xlabel('', fontsize=16)

*--snip--*

Each time we examine a row, we try to extract the date and the high

and low temperature

1

. If any data is missing, Python will raise a

ValueError

and we handle it by printing an error message that includes the date of the   
missing data

2

. After printing the error, the loop will continue processing

the next row. If all data for a date is retrieved without error, the

else

block

will run and the data will be appended to the appropriate lists

3

. Because

we're plotting information for a new location, we update the title to include   
the location on the plot, and we use a smaller font size to accommodate the   
longer title

4

.

When you run *death_valley_highs_lows.py* now, you'll see that only one

date had missing data:

Missing data for 2021-05-04 00:00:00

Because the error is handled appropriately, our code is able to generate a

plot, which skips over the missing data. Figure 16-6 shows the resulting plot.

Comparing this graph to the Sitka graph, we can see that Death Valley

is warmer overall than southeast Alaska, as we expect. Also, the range of   
temperatures each day is greater in the desert. The height of the shaded   
region makes this clear.

Many datasets you work with will have missing, improperly formatted,

or incorrect data. You can use the tools you learned in the first half of this   
book to handle these situations. Here we used a

try

else

block to

handle missing data. Sometimes you'll use

continue

to skip over some data,

or use

remove()

or

del

to eliminate some data after it's been extracted. Use

any approach that works, as long as the result is a meaningful, accurate   
visualization.

***Downloading Your Own Data***

To download your own weather data, follow these steps:

1. Visit the NOAA Climate Data Online site at [*https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/*](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web)

[*cdo-web*](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web). In the Discover Data By section, click **Search Tool** . In the Select   
a Dataset box, choose **Daily Summaries**.

2. Select a date range, and in the Search For section, choose **ZIP Codes**.

Enter the ZIP code you're interested in and click **Search**.

3. On the next page, you'll see a map and some information about the

area you're focusing on. Below the location name, click **View Full
Details** , or click the map and then click **Full Details**.

4. Scroll down and click **Station List** to see the weather stations that are

available in this area. Click one of the station names and then click   
**Add to Cart** . This data is free, even though the site uses a shopping cart   
icon. In the upper-right corner, click the cart.

5. In Select the Output Format, choose **Custom GHCN-Daily CSV**. Make

sure the date range is correct and click **Continue**.

Chapter 16

6. On the next page, you can select the kinds of data you want. You can

download one kind of data (for example, focusing on air temperature)   
or you can download all the data available from this station. Make your   
choices and then click **Continue**.

7. On the last page, you'll see a summary of your order. Enter your email

address and click **Submit Order** . You'll receive a confirmation that your   
order was received, and in a few minutes, you should receive another   
email with a link to download your data.

The data you download should be structured just like the data we

worked with in this section. It might have different headers than those you   
saw in this section, but if you follow the same steps we used here, you should   
be able to generate visualizations of the data you're interested in.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**16-1. Sitka Rainfall:**

Sitka is located in a temperate rainforest, so it gets a fair

amount of rainfall. In the data file

*sitka_weather_2021_full.csv*

is a header called

PRCP

, which represents daily rainfall amounts. Make a visualization focusing on

the data in this column. You can repeat the exercise for Death Valley if you're   
curious how little rainfall occurs in a desert.

**16-2. Sitka--Death Valley Comparison:**

The temperature scales on the Sitka and

Death Valley graphs reflect the different data ranges. To accurately compare   
the temperature range in Sitka to that of Death Valley, you need identical scales   
on the

*y*

-axis. Change the settings for the

*y*

-axis on one or both of the charts in

Figures 16-5 and 16-6. Then make a direct comparison between temperature   
ranges in Sitka and Death Valley (or any two places you want to compare).

**16-3. San Francisco:**

Are temperatures in San Francisco more like tempera-

tures in Sitka or temperatures in Death Valley? Download some data for San   
Francisco, and generate a high-low temperature plot for San Francisco to make   
a comparison.

**16-4. Automatic Indexes:**

In this section, we hardcoded the indexes correspond-

ing to the

TMIN

and

TMAX

columns. Use the header row to determine the indexes

for these values, so your program can work for Sitka or Death Valley. Use the sta-  
tion name to automatically generate an appropriate title for your graph as well.

**16-5. Explore:**

Generate a few more visualizations that examine any other

weather aspect you're interested in for any locations you're curious about.

**Mapping Global Datasets: GeoJSON Format**

In this section, you'll download a dataset representing all the earthquakes   
that have occurred in the world during the previous month. Then you'll   
make a map showing the location of these earthquakes and how significant  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress381.png)

each one was. Because the data is stored in the GeoJSON format, we'll work   
with it using the

json

module. Using Plotly's

scatter_geo()

plot, you'll create

visualizations that clearly show the global distribution of earthquakes.

***Downloading Earthquake Data***

Make a folder called *eq_data* inside the folder where you're saving this   
chapter's programs. Copy the file *eq_1_day_m1.geojson* into this new folder.   
Earthquakes are categorized by their magnitude on the Richter scale. This   
file includes data for all earthquakes with a magnitude M1 or greater that   
took place in the last 24 hours (at the time of this writing). This data comes   
from one of the United States Geological Survey's earthquake data feeds, at   
[*https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed*.](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed)

***Examining GeoJSON Data***

When you open *eq_1_day_m1.geojson* , you'll see that it's very dense and hard   
to read:

{"type":"FeatureCollection","metadata":{"generated":1649052296000,...  
{"type":"Feature","properties":{"mag":1.6,"place":"63 km SE of Ped...  
{"type":"Feature","properties":{"mag":2.2,"place":"27 km SSE of Ca...  
{"type":"Feature","properties":{"mag":3.7,"place":"102 km SSE of S...  
{"type":"Feature","properties":{"mag":2.92000008,"place":"49 km SE...  
{"type":"Feature","properties":{"mag":1.4,"place":"44 km NE of Sus...

*--snip--*

This file is formatted more for machines than humans. But we can see

that the file contains some dictionaries, as well as information that we're   
interested in, such as earthquake magnitudes and locations.

The

json

module provides a variety of tools for exploring and working

with JSON data. Some of these tools will help us reformat the file so we can   
look at the raw data more easily before we work with it programmatically.

Let's start by loading the data and displaying it in a format that's easier

to read. This is a long data file, so instead of printing it, we'll rewrite the   
data to a new file. Then we can open that file and scroll back and forth   
through the data more easily:

*eq_explore*

*_data.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

# Read data as a string and convert to a Python object.  
path = Path('eq_data/eq_data_1_day_m1.geojson')  
contents = path.read_text()

1

all_eq_data = json.loads(contents)

# Create a more readable version of the data file.

2

path = Path('eq_data/readable_eq_data.geojson')

3

readable_contents = json.dumps(all_eq_data, indent=4)

path.write_text(readable_contents)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress382.png)

**344**

Chapter 16

We read the data file as a string, and use

json.loads()

to convert the

string representation of the file to a Python object

1

. This is the same

approach we used in [Chapter 10](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#221). In this case, the entire dataset is converted   
to a single dictionary, which we assign to

all_eq_data

. We then define a new

path

where we can write this same data in a more readable format

2

. The

json.dumps()

function that you saw in [Chapter 10](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#221) can take an optional

indent

argument

3

, which tells it how much to indent nested elements in the data

structure.

When you look in your *eq_data* directory and open the file *readable_eq*

*_data.json*, here's the first part of what you'll see:

*readable_eq*

*_data.json*

{  
"type": "FeatureCollection",

1

"metadata": {

"generated": 1649052296000,  
"url": "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/.../1.0_day.geojson",  
"title": "USGS Magnitude 1.0+ Earthquakes, Past Day",  
"status": 200,  
"api": "1.10.3",  
"count": 160  
},

2

"features": \[

*--snip--*

The first part of the file includes a section with the key

"metadata"

1

.

This tells us when the data file was generated and where we can find the   
data online. It also gives us a human-readable title and the number of   
earthquakes included in this file. In this 24-hour period,

160

earthquakes

were recorded.

This GeoJSON file has a structure that's helpful for location-based data.

The information is stored in a list associated with the key

"features"

2

.

Because this file contains earthquake data, the data is in list form where   
every item in the list corresponds to a single earthquake. This structure   
might look confusing, but it's quite powerful. It allows geologists to store as   
much information as they need to in a dictionary about each earthquake,   
and then stuff all those dictionaries into one big list.

Let's look at a dictionary representing a single earthquake:

*readable_eq*

*_data.json*

*--snip--*

{  
"type": "Feature",

1

"properties": {

"mag": 1.6,

*--snip--*

2

"title": "M 1.6 - 27 km NNW of Susitna, Alaska"

},

3

"geometry": {

"type": "Point",  
"coordinates": \[

4

-150.7585,

5

61.7591,

56.3  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress383.png)

Downloading Data

**345**

\]  
},  
"id": "ak0224bju1jx"  
},

The key

"properties"

contains a lot of information about each earth-

quake

1

. We're mainly interested in the magnitude of each earthquake,

associated with the key

"mag"

. We're also interested in the

"title"

of each

event, which provides a nice summary of its magnitude and location

2

.

The key

"geometry"

helps us understand where the earthquake occurred

3

.

We'll need this information to map each event. We can find the longitude

4

and the latitude

5

for each earthquake in a list associated with the key

"coordinates"

.

This file contains way more nesting than we'd use in the code we write,

so if it looks confusing, don't worry: Python will handle most of the com-  
plexity. We'll only be working with one or two nesting levels at a time. We'll   
start by pulling out a dictionary for each earthquake that was recorded in   
the 24-hour time period.

**N O T E**

*When we talk about locations, we often say the location's latitude first, followed by its*

*longitude. This convention probably arose because humans discovered latitude long
before we developed the concept of longitude. However, many geospatial frameworks
list the longitude first and then the latitude, because this corresponds to the (* x*,* y*)
convention we use in mathematical representations. The GeoJSON format follows the
(longitude, latitude) convention. If you use a different framework, it's important to
learn what convention that framework follows.*

***Making a List of All Earthquakes***

First, we'll make a list that contains all the information about every earth-  
quake that occurred.

*eq_explore*

*_data.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

# Read data as a string and convert to a Python object.  
path = Path('eq_data/eq_data_1_day_m1.geojson')  
contents = path.read_text()  
all_eq_data = json.loads(contents)

# Examine all earthquakes in the dataset.  
all_eq_dicts = all_eq_data\['features'\]  
print(len(all_eq_dicts))

We take the data associated with the key

'features'

in the

all_eq_data

dictionary, and assign it to

all_eq_dicts

. We know this file contains records

of 160 earthquakes, and the output verifies that we've captured all the   
earthquakes in the file:

160  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress384.png)

**346**

Chapter 16

Notice how short this code is. The neatly formatted file *readable_eq_data*

*.json* has over 6,000 lines. But in just a few lines, we can read through all   
that data and store it in a Python list. Next, we'll pull the magnitudes from   
each earthquake.

***Extracting Magnitudes***

We can loop through the list containing data about each earthquake, and   
extract any information we want. Let's pull out the magnitude of each   
earthquake:

*eq_explore*

*_data.py*

*--snip--*

all_eq_dicts = all_eq_data\['features'\]

1

mags = \[\]

for eq_dict in all_eq_dicts:

2

mag = eq_dict\['properties'\]\['mag'\]

mags.append(mag)

print(mags\[:10\])

We make an empty list to store the magnitudes, and then loop through

the list

all_eq_dicts

1

. Inside this loop, each earthquake is represented by the

dictionary

eq_dict

. Each earthquake's magnitude is stored in the

'properties'

section of this dictionary, under the key

'mag'

2

. We store each magnitude in

the variable

mag

and then append it to the list

mags

.

We print the first

10

magnitudes, so we can see whether we're getting

the correct data:

\[1.6, 1.6, 2.2, 3.7, 2.92000008, 1.4, 4.6, 4.5, 1.9, 1.8\]

Next, we'll pull the location data for each earthquake, and then we can

make a map of the earthquakes.

***Extracting Location Data***

The location data for each earthquake is stored under the key

"geometry"

.

Inside the geometry dictionary is a

"coordinates"

key, and the first two values

in this list are the longitude and latitude. Here's how we'll pull this data:

*eq_explore*

*_data.py*

*--snip--*

all_eq_dicts = all_eq_data\['features'\]

mags, lons, lats = \[\], \[\], \[\]

for eq_dict in all_eq_dicts:  
mag = eq_dict\['properties'\]\['mag'\]

1

lon = eq_dict\['geometry'\]\['coordinates'\]\[0\]

lat = eq_dict\['geometry'\]\['coordinates'\]\[1\]

mags.append(mag)

lons.append(lon)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress385.png)

Downloading Data

**347**

lats.append(lat)

print(mags\[:10\])

print(lons\[:5\])  
print(lats\[:5\])

We make empty lists for the longitudes and latitudes. The code

eq_dict\['geometry'\]

accesses the dictionary representing the geometry ele-

ment of the earthquake

1

. The second key,

'coordinates'

, pulls the list

of values associated with

'coordinates'

. Finally, the

0

index asks for the first

value in the list of coordinates, which corresponds to an earthquake's   
longitude.

When we print the first

5

longitudes and latitudes, the output shows

that we're pulling the correct data:

\[1.6, 1.6, 2.2, 3.7, 2.92000008, 1.4, 4.6, 4.5, 1.9, 1.8\]

\[-150.7585, -153.4716, -148.7531, -159.6267, -155.248336791992\]  
\[61.7591, 59.3152, 63.1633, 54.5612, 18.7551670074463\]

With this data, we can move on to mapping each earthquake.

***Building a World Map***

Using the information we've pulled so far, we can build a simple world map.   
Although it won't look presentable yet, we want to make sure the informa-  
tion is displayed correctly before focusing on style and presentation issues.   
Here's the initial map:

*eq_world*

*_map.py*

from pathlib import Path  
import json

import plotly.express as px

*--snip--*

for eq_dict in all_eq_dicts:  

*--snip--*

title = 'Global Earthquakes'

1

fig = px.scatter_geo(lat=lats, lon=lons, title=title)

fig.show()

We import

plotly.express

with the alias

px

, just as we did in [Chapter 15.](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#339)

The

scatter_geo()

function

1

allows you to overlay a scatterplot of geo-

graphic data on a map. In the simplest use of this chart type, you only need   
to provide a list of latitudes and a list of longitudes. We pass the list

lats

to

the

lat

argument, and

lons

to the

lon

argument.

When you run this file, you should see a map that looks like the one in

Figure 16-7. This again shows the power of the Plotly Express library; in just   
three lines of code, we have a map of global earthquake activity.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress386.png)

**348**

Chapter 16

*Figure 16-7: A simple map showing where all the earthquakes in the last 24 hours*

*occurred*

Now that we know the information in our dataset is being plotted cor-

rectly, we can make a few changes to make the map more meaningful and   
easier to read.

***Representing Magnitudes***

A map of earthquake activity should show the magnitude of each earth-  
quake. We can also include more data, now that we know the data is being   
plotted correctly.

*--snip--*

# Read data as a string and convert to a Python object.

path = Path('eq_data/eq_data_30_day_m1.geojson')

contents = path.read_text()

*--snip--*

title = 'Global Earthquakes'

fig = px.scatter_geo(lat=lats, lon=lons, size=mags, title=title)

fig.show()

We load the file *eq_data_30_day_m1.geojson*, to include a full 30 days' worth

of earthquake activity. We also use the size argument in the

px.scatter_geo()

call, which specifies how the points on the map will be sized. We pass the list

mags

to

size

, so earthquakes with a higher magnitude will show up as larger

points on the map.

The resulting map is shown in Figure 16-8. Earthquakes usually

occur near tectonic plate boundaries, and the longer period of earth-  
quake activity included in this map reveals the exact locations of these   
boundaries.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress387.png)

Downloading Data

**349**

*Figure 16-8: The map now shows the magnitude of all earthquakes in the last 30 days.*

This map is better, but it's still difficult to pick out which points repre-

sent the most significant earthquakes. We can improve this further by using   
color to represent magnitudes as well.

***Customizing Marker Colors***

We can use Plotly's color scales to customize each marker's color, according   
to the severity of the corresponding earthquake. We'll also use a different   
projection for the base map.

*eq_world*

*_map.py*

*--snip--*

fig = px.scatter_geo(lat=lats, lon=lons, size=mags, title=title,

1

color=mags,

2

color_continuous_scale='Viridis',

3

labels={'color':'Magnitude'},

4

projection='natural earth',

)

fig.show()

All the significant changes here occur in the

px.scatter_geo()

function

call. The

color

argument tells Plotly what values it should use to determine

where each marker falls on the color scale

1

. We use the

mags

list to deter-

mine the color for each point, just as we did with the

size

argument.

The

color_continuous_scale

argument tells Plotly which color scale to

use

2

. *Viridis* is a color scale that ranges from dark blue to bright yellow,

and it works well for this dataset. By default, the color scale on the right of   
the map is labeled *color* ; this is not representative of what the colors actually   
mean. The

labels

argument, shown in [Chapter 15, t](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#339)akes a dictionary as a

value

3

. We only need to set one custom label on this chart, making sure

the color scale is labeled *Magnitude* instead of *color*.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress388.png)

**350**

Chapter 16

We add one more argument, to modify the base map over which the

earthquakes are plotted. The

projection

argument accepts a number of com-

mon map projections

4

. Here we use the

'natural earth'

projection, which

rounds the ends of the map. Also, note the trailing comma after this last   
argument. When a function call has a long list of arguments spanning mul-  
tiple lines like this, it's common practice to add a trailing comma so you're   
always ready to add another argument on the next line.

When you run the program now, you'll see a much nicer-looking map.

In Figure 16-9, the color scale shows the severity of individual earthquakes;   
the most severe earthquakes stand out as light-yellow points, in contrast to   
many darker points. You can also tell which regions of the world have more   
significant earthquake activity.

*Figure 16-9: In 30 days' worth of earthquakes, color and size are used to represent*

*the magnitude of each earthquake.*

***Other Color Scales***

You can choose from a number of other color scales. To see the available   
color scales, enter the following two lines in a Python terminal session:

\>\>\>

**import plotly.express as px**

\>\>\>

**px.colors.named_colorscales()**

\['aggrnyl', 'agsunset', 'blackbody', ..., 'mygbm'\]

Feel free to try out these color scales in the earthquake map, or with any

dataset where continuously varying colors can help show patterns in the data.

***Adding Hover Text***

To finish this map, we'll add some informative text that appears when you   
hover over the marker representing an earthquake. In addition to showing   
the longitude and latitude, which appear by default, we'll show the magni-  
tude and provide a description of the approximate location as well.

Downloading Data

**351**

To make this change, we need to pull a little more data from the file:

*eq_world*

*_map.py*

*--snip--*

1

mags, lons, lats, eq_titles = \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]

mag = eq_dict\['properties'\]\['mag'\]  
lon = eq_dict\['geometry'\]\['coordinates'\]\[0\]  
lat = eq_dict\['geometry'\]\['coordinates'\]\[1\]

2

eq_title = eq_dict\['properties'\]\['title'\]

mags.append(mag)  
lons.append(lon)  
lats.append(lat)

eq_titles.append(eq_title)

title = 'Global Earthquakes'  
fig = px.scatter_geo(lat=lats, lon=lons, size=mags, title=title,  

*--snip--*

projection='natural earth',

3

hover_name=eq_titles,

)  
fig.show()

We first make a list called

eq_titles

to store the title of each earth-

quake

1

. The

'title'

section of the data contains a descriptive name of

the magnitude and location of each earthquake, in addition to its longi-  
tude and latitude. We pull this information and assign it to the variable

eq_title

2

, and then append it to the list

eq_titles

.

In the

px.scatter_geo()

call, we pass

eq_titles

to the

hover_name

argu-

ment

3

. Plotly will now add the information from the title of each earthquake

to the hover text on each point. When you run this program, you should be   
able to hover over any marker, see a description of where that earthquake took   
place, and read its exact magnitude. An example of this information is shown   
in Figure 16-10.

*Figure 16-10: The hover text now includes a summary of each earthquake.*

This is impressive! In less than 30 lines of code, we've created a visu-

ally appealing and meaningful map of global earthquake activity that also  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress390.png)

Chapter 16

illustrates the geological structure of the planet. Plotly offers a wide range   
of ways you can customize the appearance and behavior of your visualiza-  
tions. Using Plotly's many options, you can make charts and maps that show   
exactly what you want them to.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**16-6. Refactoring:**

The loop that pulls data from

all_eq_dicts

uses variables for

the magnitude, longitude, latitude, and title of each earthquake before append-  
ing these values to their appropriate lists. This approach was chosen for clarity   
in how to pull data from a GeoJSON file, but it's not necessary in your code.   
Instead of using these temporary variables, pull each value from

eq_dict

and

append it to the appropriate list in one line. Doing so should shorten the body   
of this loop to just four lines.

**16-7. Automated Title:**

In this section, we used the generic title

*Global*

*Earthquakes*

. Instead, you can use the title for the dataset in the metadata part

of the GeoJSON file. Pull this value and assign it to the variable

title

.

**16-8. Recent Earthquakes:**

You can find online data files containing information

about the most recent earthquakes over 1-hour, 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day peri-  
ods. Go to

[*https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php*](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

and

you'll see a list of links to datasets for various time periods, focusing on earth-  
quakes of different magnitudes. Download one of these datasets and create a   
visualization of the most recent earthquake activity.

**16-9. World Fires:**

In the resources for this chapter, you'll find a file called

*world_fires_1_day.csv*

. This file contains information about fires burning in differ-

ent locations around the globe, including the latitude, longitude, and brightness   
of each fire. Using the data-processing work from the first part of this chapter   
and the mapping work from this section, make a map that shows which parts of   
the world are affected by fires.

You can download more recent versions of this data at

[*https://earthdata*](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data)

[*.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data*](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data)

[. Y](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data)ou can

find links to the data in CSV format in the

*SHP, KML, and TXT Files*

section.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to work with real-world datasets. You pro-  
cessed CSV and GeoJSON files, and extracted the data you want to focus   
on. Using historical weather data, you learned more about working with   
Matplotlib, including how to use the

datetime

module and how to plot multi-

ple data series on one chart. You plotted geographical data on a world map   
in Plotly, and learned to customize the style of the map.

As you gain experience working with CSV and JSON files, you'll be able

to process almost any data you want to analyze. You can download most   
online datasets in either or both of these formats. By working with these

formats, you'll be able to learn how to work with other data formats more   
easily as well.

In the next chapter, you'll write programs that automatically gather

their own data from online sources, and then you'll create visualizations   
of that data. These are fun skills to have if you want to program as a hobby   
and are critical skills if you're interested in programming professionally.

**W O R K I N G W I T H A P I S**

In this chapter, you'll learn how to write

a self-contained program that generates a

visualization based on data it retrieves. Your

program will use an *application programming*

*interface (API)* to automatically request specific infor-  
mation from a website and then use that information   
to generate a visualization. Because programs written

like this will always use current data to generate a visualization, even   
when that data might be rapidly changing, the visualization will always   
be up to date.

**Using an API**

An API is a part of a website designed to interact with programs. Those   
programs use very specific URLs to request certain information. This kind   
of request is called an *API call*. The requested data will be returned in an  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress394.png)

**356**

Chapter 17

easily processed format, such as JSON or CSV. Most apps that use external   
data sources, such as apps that integrate with social media sites, rely on   
API calls.

***Git and GitHub***

We'll base our visualization on information from GitHu[b (*https://github.com*),](https://github.com)   
a site that allows programmers to collaborate on coding projects. We'll use   
GitHub's API to request information about Python projects on the site, and   
then generate an interactive visualization of the relative popularity of these   
projects using Plotly.

GitHub takes its name from Git, a distributed version control system.

Git helps people manage their work on a project in a way that prevents   
changes made by one person from interfering with changes other people   
are making. When you implement a new feature in a project, Git tracks the   
changes you make to each file. When your new code works, you *commit*   
the changes you've made, and Git records the new state of your project. If   
you make a mistake and want to revert your changes, you can easily return   
to any previously working state. (To learn more about version control using   
Git, see [Appendix D.](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#521)) Projects on GitHub are stored in *repositories* , which   
contain everything associated with the project: its code, information on its   
collaborators, any issues or bug reports, and so on.

When users on GitHub like a project, they can "star" it to show their

support and keep track of projects they might want to use. In this chapter,   
we'll write a program to automatically download information about the   
most-starred Python projects on GitHub, and then we'll create an informa-  
tive visualization of these projects.

***Requesting Data Using an API Call***

GitHub's API lets you request a wide range of information through API   
calls. To see what an API call looks like, enter the following into your brows-  
er's address bar and press ENTER:

**https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:python+sort:stars**

This call returns the number of Python projects currently hosted on

GitHub, as well as information about the most popular Python repositories.   
Let's examine the call. The first part,

https://api.github.com/

, directs the

request to the part of GitHub that responds to API calls. The next part,

search/repositories

, tells the API to conduct a search through all the reposi-

tories on GitHub.

The question mark after

repositories

signals that we're about to pass

an argument. The

q

stands for *query*, and the equal sign (

=

) lets us begin

specifying a query (

q=

). By using

language:python

, we indicate that we want

information only on repositories that have Python as the primary language.   
The final part,

+sort:stars

, sorts the projects by the number of stars they've

been given.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress395.png)

Working with APIs

**357**

The following snippet shows the first few lines of the response:

{

1

"total_count": 8961993,

2

"incomplete_results": true,

3

"items": \[

{  
"id": 54346799,  
"node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDM0Njc5OQ==",  
"name": "public-apis",  
"full_name": "public-apis/public-apis",

*--snip--*

You can see from the response that this URL is not primarily intended

to be entered by humans, because it's in a format that's meant to be pro-  
cessed by a program. GitHub found just under nine million Python projects   
as of this writing

1

. The value for

"incomplete_results"

is

true

, which tells us

that GitHub didn't fully process the query

2

. GitHub limits how long each

query can run, in order to keep the API responsive for all users. In this case   
it found some of the most popular Python repositories, but it didn't have   
time to find all of them; we'll fix that in a moment. The

"items"

returned

are displayed in the list that follows, which contains details about the most   
popular Python projects on GitHub

3

.

***Installing Requests***

The *Requests* package allows a Python program to easily request information   
from a website and examine the response. Use pip to install Requests:

$

**python -m pip install --user requests**

If you use a command other than

**python**

to run programs or start a ter-

minal session, such as

**python3**

, your command will look like this:

$

**python3 -m pip install --user requests**

***Processing an API Response***

Now we'll write a program to automatically issue an API call and process   
the results:

*python*

*_repos.py*

import requests

# Make an API call and check the response.

1

url = "https://api.github.com/search/repositories"

url += "?q=language:python+sort:stars+stars:\>10000"

2

headers = {"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"}

3

r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

4

print(f"Status code: {r.status_code}")  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress396.png)

**358**

Chapter 17

# Convert the response object to a dictionary.

5

response_dict = r.json()

# Process results.  
print(response_dict.keys())

We first import the

requests

module. Then we assign the URL of the

API call to the

url

variable

1

. This is a long URL, so we break it into two

lines. The first line is the main part of the URL, and the second line is   
the query string. We've included one more condition to the original query   
string:

stars:\>10000

, which tells GitHub to only look for Python repositories

that have more than 10,000 stars. This should allow GitHub to return a   
complete, consistent set of results.

GitHub is currently on the third version of its API, so we define headers

for the API call that ask explicitly to use this version of the API, and return   
the results in the JSON format

2

. Then we use

requests

to make the call

to the API

3

. We call

get()

and pass it the URL and the header that we

defined, and we assign the response object to the variable

r

.

The response object has an attribute called

status_code

, which tells us

whether the request was successful. (A status code of 200 indicates a success-  
ful response.) We print the value of

status_code

so we can make sure the call

went through successfully

4

. We asked the API to return the information in

JSON format, so we use the

json()

method to convert the information to a

Python dictionary

5

. We assign the resulting dictionary to

response_dict

.

Finally, we print the keys from

response_dict

and see the following

output:

Status code: 200  
dict_keys(\['total_count', 'incomplete_results', 'items'\])

Because the status code is

200

, we know that the request was successful.

The response dictionary contains only three keys:

'total_count'

,

'incomplete

_results'

, and

'items'

. Let's take a look inside the response dictionary.

***Working with the Response Dictionary***

With the information from the API call represented as a dictionary, we   
can work with the data stored there. Let's generate some output that sum-  
marizes the information. This is a good way to make sure we received the   
information we expected, and to start examining the information we're   
interested in:

*python*

*_repos.py*

import requests

# Make an API call and store the response.

*--snip--*

# Convert the response object to a dictionary.  
response_dict = r.json()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress397.png)

Working with APIs

**359**

1

print(f"Total repositories: {response_dict\['total_count'\]}")

print(f"Complete results: {not response_dict\['incomplete_results'\]}")

# Explore information about the repositories.

2

repo_dicts = response_dict\['items'\]

print(f"Repositories returned: {len(repo_dicts)}")

# Examine the first repository.

3

repo_dict = repo_dicts\[0\]

4

print(f"\\nKeys: {len(repo_dict)}")

5

for key in sorted(repo_dict.keys()):

print(key)

We start exploring the response dictionary by printing the value asso-

ciated with

'total_count'

, which represents the total number of Python

repositories returned by this API call

1

. We also use the value associated

with

'incomplete_results'

, so we'll know if GitHub was able to fully process

the query. Rather than printing this value directly, we print its opposite: a   
value of

True

will indicate that we received a complete set of results.

The value associated with

'items'

is a list containing a number of dic-

tionaries, each of which contains data about an individual Python reposi-  
tory. We assign this list of dictionaries to

repo_dicts

2

. We then print the

length of

repo_dicts

to see how many repositories we have information for.

To look closer at the information returned about each repository, we

pull out the first item from

repo_dicts

and assign it to

repo_dict

3

. We then

print the number of keys in the dictionary to see how much information we   
have

4

. Finally, we print all the dictionary's keys to see what kind of infor-

mation is included

5

.

The results give us a clearer picture of the actual data:

Status code: 200

1

Total repositories: 248

2

Complete results: True

Repositories returned: 30

3

Keys: 78

allow_forking  
archive_url  
archived

*--snip--*

url  
visiblity  
watchers  
watchers_count

At the time of this writing, there are only

248

Python repositories with

over 10,000 stars

1

. We can see that GitHub was able to fully process the

API call

2

. In this response, GitHub returned information about the first

30

repositories that match the conditions of our query. If we want more reposi-  
tories, we can request additional pages of data.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress398.png)

**360**

Chapter 17

GitHub's API returns a lot of information about each repository: there

are

78

keys in

repo_dict

3

. When you look through these keys, you'll get

a sense of the kind of information you can extract about a project. (The   
only way to know what information is available through an API is to read   
the documentation or to examine the information through code, as we're   
doing here.)

Let's pull out the values for some of the keys in

repo_dict

:

*python*

*_repos.py*

*--snip--*

# Examine the first repository.  
repo_dict = repo_dicts\[0\]

print("\\nSelected information about first repository:")

1

print(f"Name: {repo_dict\['name'\]}")

2

print(f"Owner: {repo_dict\['owner'\]\['login'\]}")

3

print(f"Stars: {repo_dict\['stargazers_count'\]}")

print(f"Repository: {repo_dict\['html_url'\]}")

4

print(f"Created: {repo_dict\['created_at'\]}")

5

print(f"Updated: {repo_dict\['updated_at'\]}")

print(f"Description: {repo_dict\['description'\]}")

Here, we print the values for a number of keys from the first repository's

dictionary. We start with the name of the project

1

. An entire dictionary

represents the project's owner, so we use the key

owner

to access the diction-

ary representing the owner, and then use the key

login

to get the owner's

login name

2

. Next, we print how many stars the project has earned

3

and

the URL for the project's GitHub repository. We then show when it was cre-  
ated

4

and when it was last updated

5

. Finally, we print the repository's

description.

The output should look something like this:

Status code: 200  
Total repositories: 248  
Complete results: True  
Repositories returned: 30

Selected information about first repository:  
Name: public-apis  
Owner: public-apis  
Stars: 191493  
Repository: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis  
Created: 2016-03-20T23:49:42Z  
Updated: 2022-05-12T06:37:11Z  
Description: A collective list of free APIs

We can see that the most-starred Python project on GitHub as of this

writing is *public-apis* . Its owner is an organization with the same name, and   
it has been starred by almost 200,000 GitHub users. We can see the URL   
for the project's repository, its creation date of March 2016, and that it was   
updated recently. Additionally, the description tells us that *public-apis* con-  
tains a list of free APIs that programmers might be interested in.

Working with APIs

**361**

***Summarizing the Top Repositories***

When we make a visualization for this data, we'll want to include more   
than one repository. Let's write a loop to print selected information about   
each repository the API call returns so we can include them all in the   
visualization:

*python*

*_repos.py*

*--snip--*

# Explore information about the repositories.  
repo_dicts = response_dict\['items'\]  
print(f"Repositories returned: {len(repo_dicts)}")

1

print("\\nSelected information about each repository:")

2

for repo_dict in repo_dicts:

print(f"\\nName: {repo_dict\['name'\]}")  
print(f"Owner: {repo_dict\['owner'\]\['login'\]}")  
print(f"Stars: {repo_dict\['stargazers_count'\]}")  
print(f"Repository: {repo_dict\['html_url'\]}")  
print(f"Description: {repo_dict\['description'\]}")

We first print an introductory message

1

. Then we loop through all

the dictionaries in

repo_dicts

2

. Inside the loop, we print the name of each

project, its owner, how many stars it has, its URL on GitHub, and the proj-  
ect's description:

Status code: 200  
Total repositories: 248  
Complete results: True  
Repositories returned: 30

Chapter 17

Some interesting projects appear in these results, and it might be worth

looking at a few. But don't spend too much time here, because we're about   
to create a visualization that will make the results much easier to read.

***Monitoring API Rate Limits***

Most APIs have *rate limits* , which means there's a limit to how many requests   
you can make in a certain amount of time. To see if you're approaching   
GitHub's limits, enter [*https://api.github.com/rate_limit*i](https://api.github.com/rate_limit )nto a web browser. You   
should see a response that begins like this:

{  
"resources": {  

*--snip--*

1

"search": {

2

"limit": 10,

3

"remaining": 9,

4

"reset": 1652338832,

"used": 1,  
"resource": "search"  
},  

*--snip--*

The information we're interested in is the rate limit for the search

API

1

. We see that the limit is 10 requests per minute

2

and that we have

9 requests remaining for the current minute

3

. The value associated with

the key

"reset"

represents the time in *Unix* or *epoch time* (the number of

seconds since midnight on January 1, 1970) when our quota will reset

4

. If

you reach your quota, you'll get a short response that lets you know you've   
reached the API limit. If you reach the limit, just wait until your quota   
resets.

**N O T E**

*Many APIs require you to register and obtain an API key or access token to make API*

*calls. As of this writing, GitHub has no such requirement, but if you obtain an access
token, your limits will be much higher.*

**Visualizing Repositories Using Plotly**

Let's make a visualization using the data we've gathered to show the rela-  
tive popularity of Python projects on GitHub. We'll make an interactive bar   
chart: the height of each bar will represent the number of stars the project   
has acquired, and you'll be able to click the bar's label to go to that project's   
home on GitHub.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress401.png)

Working with APIs

**363**

Save a copy of the program we've been working on as *python_repos*

*_visual.py*, then modify it so it reads as follows:

*python_repos*

*_visual.py*

import requests

import plotly.express as px

# Make an API call and check the response.  
url = "https://api.github.com/search/repositories"  
url += "?q=language:python+sort:stars+stars:\>10000"

headers = {"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"}  
r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

1

print(f"Status code: {r.status_code}")

# Process overall results.

response_dict = r.json()

2

print(f"Complete results: {not response_dict\['incomplete_results'\]}")

# Process repository information.

repo_dicts = response_dict\['items'\]

3

repo_names, stars = \[\], \[\]

for repo_dict in repo_dicts:

repo_names.append(repo_dict\['name'\])  
stars.append(repo_dict\['stargazers_count'\])

# Make visualization.

4

fig = px.bar(x=repo_names, y=stars)

fig.show()

We import Plotly Express and then make the API call as we have been

doing. We continue to print the status of the API call response so we'll   
know if there is a problem

1

. When we process the overall results, we

continue to print the message confirming that we got a complete set of   
results

2

. We remove the rest of the

print()

calls because we're no longer in

the exploratory phase; we know we have the data we want.

We then create two empty lists

3

to store the data we'll include in the

initial chart. We'll need the name of each project to label the bars (

repo_names

)

and the number of stars to determine the height of the bars (

stars

). In the

loop, we append the name of each project and the number of stars it has to   
these lists.

We make the initial visualization with just two lines of code

4

. This is

consistent with Plotly Express's philosophy that you should be able to see   
your visualization as quickly as possible before refining its appearance.   
Here we use the

px.bar()

function to create a bar chart. We pass the list

repo_names

as the

x

argument and

stars

as the

y

argument.

Figure 17-1 shows the resulting chart. We can see that the first few projects

are significantly more popular than the rest, but all of them are important   
projects in the Python ecosystem.

***Styling the Chart***

Plotly supports a number of ways to style and customize the plots, once you   
know the information in the plot is correct. We'll make some changes in   
the initial

px.bar()

call and then make some further adjustments to the

fig

object after it's been created.

We'll start styling the chart by adding a title and labels for each axis:

*python_repos*

*_visual.py*

*--snip--*

# Make visualization.

title = "Most-Starred Python Projects on GitHub"  
labels = {'x': 'Repository', 'y': 'Stars'}  
fig = px.bar(x=repo_names, y=stars, title=title, labels=labels)

1

fig.update_layout(title_font_size=28, xaxis_title_font_size=20,

yaxis_title_font_size=20)

fig.show()

We first add a title and labels for each axis, as we did in [Chapters 15](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#339) and

[16. W](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#367)e then use the

fig.update_layout()

method to modify specific elements

of the chart

1

. Plotly uses a convention where aspects of a chart element are

connected by underscores. As you become familiar with Plotly's documen-  
tation, you'll start to see consistent patterns in how different elements of a   
chart are named and modified. Here we set the title font size to

28

and the

font size for each axis title to

20

. The result is shown in Figure 17-2.

*Figure 17-2: A title has been added to the main chart, and to each axis as well.*

***Adding Custom Tooltips***

In Plotly, you can hover the cursor over an individual bar to show the infor-  
mation the bar represents. This is commonly called a *tooltip* , and in this   
case, it currently shows the number of stars a project has. Let's create a cus-  
tom tooltip to show each project's description as well as the project's owner.

We need to pull some additional data to generate the tooltips:

*python_repos*

*_visual.py*

*--snip--*

# Process repository information.  
repo_dicts = response_dict\['items'\]

1

repo_names, stars, hover_texts = \[\], \[\], \[\]

for repo_dict in repo_dicts:  
repo_names.append(repo_dict\['name'\])  
stars.append(repo_dict\['stargazers_count'\])

# Build hover texts.

2

owner = repo_dict\['owner'\]\['login'\]

description = repo_dict\['description'\]

3

hover_text = f"{owner}\<br /\>{description}"

hover_texts.append(hover_text)

# Make visualization.  
title = "Most-Starred Python Projects on GitHub"  
labels = {'x': 'Repository', 'y': 'Stars'}

4

fig = px.bar(x=repo_names, y=stars, title=title, labels=labels,

hover_name=hover_texts)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress404.png)

**366**

Chapter 17

fig.update_layout(title_font_size=28, xaxis_title_font_size=20,  
yaxis_title_font_size=20)

fig.show()

We first define a new empty list,

hover_texts

, to hold the text we want to

display for each project

1

. In the loop where we process the data, we pull

the owner and the description for each project

2

. Plotly allows you to use

HTML code within text elements, so we generate a string for the label with   
a line break (

\<br /\>

) between the project owner's username and the descrip-

tion

3

. We then append this label to the list

hover_texts

.

In the

px.bar()

call, we add the

hover_name

argument and pass it

hover

_texts

4

. This is the same approach we used to customize the label for each

dot in the map of global earthquake activity. As Plotly creates each bar, it   
will pull labels from this list and only display them when the viewer hovers   
over a bar. Figure 17-3 shows one of these custom tooltips.

*Figure 17-3: Hovering over a bar shows the project's owner and description.*

***Adding Clickable Links***

Because Plotly allows you to use HTML on text elements, we can easily add   
links to a chart. Let's use the *x* -axis labels as a way to let the viewer visit any   
project's home page on GitHub. We need to pull the URLs from the data   
and use them when generating the *x*-axis labels:

*python_repos*

*_visual.py*

*--snip--*

# Process repository information.  
repo_dicts = response_dict\['items'\]

1

repo_links, stars, hover_texts = \[\], \[\], \[\]

for repo_dict in repo_dicts:

# Turn repo names into active links.  
repo_name = repo_dict\['name'\]

2

repo_url = repo_dict\['html_url'\]  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress405.png)

Working with APIs

**367**

3

repo_link = f"\<a href='{repo_url}'\>{repo_name}\</a\>"

repo_links.append(repo_link)

stars.append(repo_dict\['stargazers_count'\])  

*--snip--*

# Make visualization.  
title = "Most-Starred Python Projects on GitHub"  
labels = {'x': 'Repository', 'y': 'Stars'}

fig = px.bar(x=repo_links, y=stars, title=title, labels=labels,

hover_name=hover_texts)

fig.update_layout(title_font_size=28, xaxis_title_font_size=20,  
yaxis_title_font_size=20)

fig.show()

We update the name of the list we're creating from

repo_names

to

repo

_links

to more accurately communicate the kind of information we're put-

ting together for the chart

1

. We then pull the URL for the project from

repo_dict

and assign it to the temporary variable

repo_url

2

. Next, we gen-

erate a link to the project

3

. We use the HTML anchor tag, which has the

form

\<a href='URL'\>link text\</a\>

, to generate the link. We then append this

link to

repo_links

.

When we call

px.bar()

, we use

repo_links

for the *x*-values in the chart.

The result looks the same as before, but now the viewer can click any of the   
project names at the bottom of the chart to visit that project's home page   
on GitHub. Now we have an interactive, informative visualization of data   
retrieved through an API!

***Customizing Marker Colors***

Once a chart has been created, almost any aspect of the chart can be cus-  
tomized through an update method. We've used the

update_layout()

method

previously. Another method,

update_traces()

, can be used to customize the

data that's represented on a chart.

Let's change the bars to a darker blue, with some transparency:

*--snip--*

fig.update_layout(title_font_size=28, xaxis_title_font_size=20,  
yaxis_title_font_size=20)

fig.update_traces(marker_color='SteelBlue', marker_opacity=0.6)

fig.show()

In Plotly, a *trace* refers to a collection of data on a chart. The

update

_traces()

method can take a number of different arguments; any argument

that starts with

marker_

affects the markers on the chart. Here we set each

marker's color to

'SteelBlue'

; any named CSS color will work here. We also set

the opacity of each marker to

0.6

. An opacity of 1.0 will be entirely opaque,

and an opacity of 0 will be entirely invisible.

***More About Plotly and the GitHub API***

Plotly's documentation is extensive and well organized; however, it can be   
hard to know where to start reading. A good place to start is with the article   
"Plotly Express in Python," a[t *https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express*](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express). This is an   
overview of all the plots you can make with Plotly Express, and you can find   
links to longer articles about each individual chart type.

If you want to understand how to customize Plotly charts better, the

article "Styling Plotly Express Figures in Python" will expand on what you've   
seen in Chapters [15--](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#339)[17](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#406). You can find this article at [*https://plotly.com/python/
styling-plotly-express*.](https://plotly.com/python/styling-plotly-express)

For more about the GitHub API, refer to its documentation a[t *https://*](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

[*docs.github.com/en/rest*. H](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)ere you'll learn how to pull a wide variety of infor-  
mation from GitHub. To expand on what you saw in this project, look for   
the Search section of the reference in the sidebar. If you have a GitHub   
account, you can work with your own data as well as the publicly available   
data from other users' repositories.

**The Hacker News API**

To explore how to use API calls on other sites, let's take a quick look at   
Hacker New[s (*https://news.ycombinator.com*)](https://news.ycombinator.com). On Hacker News, people share   
articles about programming and technology and engage in lively discus-  
sions about those articles. The Hacker News API provides access to data   
about all submissions and comments on the site, and you can use the API   
without having to register for a key.

The following call returns information about the current top article as

of this writing:

https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/31353677.json

When you enter this URL in a browser, you'll see that the text on the

page is enclosed by braces, meaning it's a dictionary. But the response is   
difficult to examine without some better formatting. Let's run this URL   
through the

json.dumps()

method, like we did in the earthquake project

i[n Chapter 16](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#367), so we can explore the kind of information that's returned   
about an article:

*hn_article.py*

import requests  
import json

# Make an API call, and store the response.  
url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/31353677.json"  
r = requests.get(url)  
print(f"Status code: {r.status_code}")

# Explore the structure of the data.  
response_dict = r.json()  
response_string = json.dumps(response_dict, indent=4)

1

print(response_string)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress407.png)

Working with APIs

**369**

Everything in this program should look familiar, because we've used

it all in the previous two chapters. The main difference here is that we can   
print the formatted response string

1

instead of writing it to a file, because

the output is not particularly long.

The output is a dictionary of information about the article with the ID

31353677

:

{  
"by": "sohkamyung",

1

"descendants": 302,

"id": 31353677,

2

"kids": \[

31354987,  
31354235,  

*--snip--*

\],  
"score": 785,  
"time": 1652361401,

3

"title": "Astronomers reveal first image of the black hole

at the heart of our galaxy",  
"type": "story",

4

"url": "https://public.nrao.edu/news/.../"

}

The dictionary contains a number of keys we can work with. The key

"descendants"

tells us the number of comments the article has received

1

.

The key

"kids"

provides the IDs of all comments made directly in response

to this submission

2

. Each of these comments might have comments of

their own as well, so the number of descendants a submission has is usually   
greater than its number of kids. We can see the title of the article being dis-  
cussed

3

and a URL for the article being discussed as well

4

.

The following URL returns a simple list of all the IDs of the current top

articles on Hacker News:

https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json

We can use this call to find out which articles are on the home page

right now, and then generate a series of API calls similar to the one we just   
examined. With this approach, we can print a summary of all the articles   
on the front page of Hacker News at the moment:

*hn*

*_submissions.py*

from operator import itemgetter

import requests

# Make an API call and check the response.

1

url = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json"

r = requests.get(url)  
print(f"Status code: {r.status_code}")

# Process information about each submission.

2

submission_ids = r.json()  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress408.png)

Chapter 17

3

submission_dicts = \[\]

for submission_id in submission_ids\[:5\]:  
# Make a new API call for each submission.

4

url = f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{submission_id}.json"

r = requests.get(url)  
print(f"id: {submission_id}\\tstatus: {r.status_code}")  
response_dict = r.json()

# Build a dictionary for each article.

5

submission_dict = {

'title': response_dict\['title'\],  
'hn_link': f"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id={submission_id}",  
'comments': response_dict\['descendants'\],  
}

6

submission_dicts.append(submission_dict)

7

submission_dicts = sorted(submission_dicts, key=itemgetter('comments'),

reverse=True)

8

for submission_dict in submission_dicts:

print(f"\\nTitle: {submission_dict\['title'\]}")  
print(f"Discussion link: {submission_dict\['hn_link'\]}")  
print(f"Comments: {submission_dict\['comments'\]}")

First, we make an API call and print the status of the response

1

. This

API call returns a list containing the IDs of up to 500 of the most popular   
articles on Hacker News at the time the call is issued. We then convert the   
response object to a Python list

2

, which we assign to

submission_ids

. We'll

use these IDs to build a set of dictionaries, each of which contains informa-  
tion about one of the current submissions.

We set up an empty list called

submission_dicts

to store these dictionar-

ies

3

. We then loop through the IDs of the top 30 submissions. We make

a new API call for each submission by generating a URL that includes the   
current value of

submission_id

4

. We print the status of each request along

with its ID, so we can see whether it's successful.

Next, we create a dictionary for the submission currently being pro-

cessed

5

. We store the title of the submission, a link to the discussion page

for that item, and the number of comments the article has received so far.   
Then we append each

submission_dict

to the list

submission_dicts

6

.

Each submission on Hacker News is ranked according to an overall

score based on a number of factors, including how many times it's been   
voted on, how many comments it's received, and how recent the submis-  
sion is. We want to sort the list of dictionaries by the number of comments.   
To do this, we use a function called

itemgetter()

7

, which comes from the

operator

module. We pass this function the key

'comments'

, and it pulls the

value associated with that key from each dictionary in the list. The

sorted()

function then uses this value as its basis for sorting the list. We sort the list   
in reverse order, to place the most-commented stories first.

Once the list is sorted, we loop through the list

8

and print out three

pieces of information about each of the top submissions: the title, a link  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress409.png)

Working with APIs

**371**

to the discussion page, and the number of comments the submission cur-  
rently has:

Status code: 200  
id: 31390506 status: 200  
id: 31389893 status: 200  
id: 31390742 status: 200

*--snip--*

You would use a similar process to access and analyze information with

any API. With this data, you could make a visualization showing which   
submissions have inspired the most active recent discussions. This is also   
the basis for apps that provide a customized reading experience for sites   
like Hacker News. To learn more about what kind of information you can   
access through the Hacker News API, visit the documentation page at   
[*https://github.com/HackerNews/API*.](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)

**N O T E**

*Hacker News sometimes allows companies it supports to make special hiring posts,*

*and comments are disabled on these posts. If you run this program while one of these
posts is present, you'll get a*

*KeyError*

*. If this causes an issue, you can wrap the code*

*that builds*

*submission_dict*

*in a*

*try-except*

*block and skip over these posts.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**17-1. Other Languages:**

Modify the API call in

*python_repos.py*

so it generates

a chart showing the most popular projects in other languages. Try languages   
such as

*JavaScript*

,

*Ruby*

,

*C*

,

*Java*

,

*Perl*

,

*Haskell*

, and

*Go*

.

**17-2. Active Discussions:**

Using the data from

*hn_submissions.py*

, make a bar

chart showing the most active discussions currently happening on Hacker News.   
The height of each bar should correspond to the number of comments each sub-  
mission has. The label for each bar should include the submission's title and act   
as a link to the discussion page for that submission. If you get a

KeyError

when

creating a chart, use a

try-except

block to skip over the promotional posts.

Chapter 17

**17-3. Testing python_repos.py:**

In

*python_repos.py*

, we printed the value of

status_code

to make sure the API call was successful. Write a program called

*test_python_repos.py*

that uses

pytest

to assert that the value of

status_code

is 200. Figure out some other assertions you can make: for example, that the   
number of items returned is expected and that the total number of repositories is   
greater than a certain amount.

**17-4. Further Exploration:**

Visit the documentation for Plotly and either the

GitHub API or the Hacker News API. Use some of the information you find there   
to either customize the style of the plots we've already made or pull some dif-  
ferent information and create your own visualizations. If you're curious about   
exploring other APIs, take a look at the APIs mentioned in the GitHub repository   
a[t](https://github.com/public-apis)

[*https://github.com/public-apis*](https://github.com/public-apis)

[.](https://github.com/public-apis)

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to use APIs to write self-contained pro-  
grams that automatically gather the data they need and use that data to   
create a visualization. You used the GitHub API to explore the most-starred   
Python projects on GitHub, and you also looked briefly at the Hacker News   
API. You learned how to use the Requests package to automatically issue   
an API call and how to process the results of that call. We also introduced   
some Plotly settings that further customize the appearance of the charts   
you generate.

In the next chapter, you'll use Django to build a web application as your

final project.

**G E T T I N G S T A R T E D W I T H D J A N G O**

As the internet has evolved, the line between

websites and mobile apps has blurred.

Websites and apps both help users interact

with data in a variety of ways. Fortunately, you

can use Django to build a single project that serves a   
dynamic website as well as a set of mobile apps. *Django*   
is Python's most popular *web framework* , a set of tools   
designed for building interactive web applications. In

this chapter, you'll learn how to use Django to build a project called Learning   
Log, an online journal system that lets you keep track of information you've   
learned about different topics.

We'll write a specification for this project, and then define models for

the data the app will work with. We'll use Django's admin system to enter   
some initial data, and then write views and templates so Django can build   
the site's pages.

Django can respond to page requests and make it easier to read and

write to a database, manage users, and much more. In Chapter[s 19](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#441) and[20,](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#471)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress412.png)

**374**

Chapter 18

you'll refine the Learning Log project, and then deploy it to a live server so   
you (and everyone else in the world) can use it.

**Setting Up a Project**

When starting work on something as significant as a web app, you first need to   
describe the project's goals in a specification, or *spec* . Once you have a clear   
set of goals, you can start to identify manageable tasks to achieve those   
goals.

In this section, we'll write a spec for Learning Log and start working on

the first phase of the project. This will involve setting up a virtual environ-  
ment and building out the initial aspects of a Django project.

***Writing a Spec***

A full spec details the project goals, describes the project's functionality,   
and discusses its appearance and user interface. Like any good project or   
business plan, a spec should keep you focused and help keep your project   
on track. We won't write a full project spec here, but we'll lay out a few clear   
goals to keep the development process focused. Here's the spec we'll use:

We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to   
log the topics they're interested in and make journal entries as   
they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page will   
describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once   
logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read   
and edit existing entries.

When you're researching a new topic, maintaining a journal of what

you've learned can help you keep track of new information and informa-  
tion you've already found. This is especially true when studying technical   
subjects. A good app, like the one we'll be creating, can help make this   
process more efficient.

***Creating a Virtual Environment***

To work with Django, we'll first set up a virtual environment. A *virtual envi-
ronment* is a place on your system where you can install packages and isolate   
them from all other Python packages. Separating one project's libraries   
from other projects is beneficial and will be necessary when we deploy   
Learning Log to a server i[n Chapter 20](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#471).

Create a new directory for your project called *learning_log*, switch to

that directory in a terminal, and enter the following code to create a virtual   
environment:

learning_log$

**python -m venv ll_env**

learning_log$

Here we're running the

venv

virtual environment module and using

it to create an environment named *ll_env* (note that this name starts with  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress413.png)

Getting Started with Django

**375**

two lowercase *L*s, not two ones). If you use a command such as

python3

when running programs or installing packages, make sure to use that   
command here.

***Activating the Virtual Environment***

Now we need to activate the virtual environment, using the following   
command:

learning_log$

**source ll_env/bin/activate**

(ll_env)learning_log$

This command runs the script *activate* in *ll_env/bin/*. When the environ-

ment is active, you'll see the name of the environment in parentheses. This   
indicates that you can install new packages to the environment and use   
packages that have already been installed. Packages you install in *ll_env* will   
not be available when the environment is inactive.

**N O T E**

*If you're using Windows, use the command*

***ll_env\\Scripts\\activate***

*(without the*

*word*

*source*

*) to activate the virtual environment. If you're using PowerShell, you*

*might need to capitalize*

*Activate*

*.*

To stop using a virtual environment, enter

**deactivate**

:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**deactivate**

learning_log$

The environment will also become inactive when you close the terminal

it's running in.

***Installing Django***

With the virtual environment activated, enter the following to update pip   
and install Django:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**pip install --upgrade pip**

(ll_env)learning_log$

**pip install django**

Collecting django

*--snip--*

Installing collected packages: sqlparse, asgiref, django  
Successfully installed asgiref-3.5.2 django-4.1 sqlparse-0.4.2  
(ll_env)learning_log$

Because it downloads resources from a variety of sources, pip is upgraded

fairly often. It's a good idea to upgrade pip whenever you make a new virtual   
environment.

We're working in a virtual environment now, so the command to install

Django is the same on all systems. There's no need to use longer com-  
mands, such as

python -m pip install

*package_name*

, or to include the

--user

flag. Keep in mind that Django will be available only when the *ll_env* envi-  
ronment is active.

**N O T E**

*Django releases a new version about every eight months, so you may see a newer ver-*

*sion when you install Django. This project will most likely work as it's written here,
even on newer versions of Django. If you want to make sure to use the same version
of Django you see here, use the command*

***pip install django==4.1.\****

*. This will*

*install the latest release of Django 4.1. If you have any issues related to the version
you're using, see the online resources for this book at* [https://ehmatthes.github.io/
pcc_3e](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e)*.*

***Creating a Project in Django***

Without leaving the active virtual environment (remember to look for *ll_env*   
in parentheses in the terminal prompt), enter the following commands to   
create a new project:

1

(ll_env)learning_log$

**django-admin startproject ll_project .**

2

(ll_env)learning_log$

**ls**

ll_env ll_project manage.py

3

(ll_env)learning_log$

**ls ll_project**

__init__.py asgi.py settings.py urls.py wsgi.py

The

startproject

command

1

tells Django to set up a new project called

*ll_project*. The dot (

.

) at the end of the command creates the new project

with a directory structure that will make it easy to deploy the app to a server   
when we're finished developing it.

**N O T E**

*Don't forget this dot, or you might run into some configuration issues when you*

*deploy the app. If you forget the dot, delete the files and folders that were created
(except* ll_env*) and run the command again.*

Running the

ls

command (

dir

on Windows)

2

shows that Django has

created a new directory called *ll_project* . It also created a *manage.py* file,   
which is a short program that takes in commands and feeds them to the   
relevant part of Django. We'll use these commands to manage tasks, such as   
working with databases and running servers.

The *ll_project* directory contains four files

3

; the most important are

*settings.py* , *urls.py* , and *wsgi.py* . The *settings.py* file controls how Django inter-  
acts with your system and manages your project. We'll modify a few of these   
settings and add some settings of our own as the project evolves. The *urls.py*   
file tells Django which pages to build in response to browser requests. The   
*wsgi.py* file helps Django serve the files it creates. The filename is an acro-  
nym for "web server gateway interface."

***Creating the Database***

Django stores most of the information for a project in a database, so next   
we need to create a database that Django can work with. Enter the follow-  
ing command (still in an active environment):

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py migrate**

1

Operations to perform:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**ls**

db.sqlite3 ll_env ll_project manage.py

Anytime we modify a database, we say we're *migrating* the database.

Issuing the

migrate

command for the first time tells Django to make sure the

database matches the current state of the project. The first time we run this   
command in a new project using SQLite (more about SQLite in a moment),   
Django will create a new database for us. Here, Django reports that it will   
prepare the database to store information it needs to handle administrative   
and authentication tasks

1

.

Running the

ls

command shows that Django created another file called

*db.sqlite3*

2

. *SQLite* is a database that runs off a single file; it's ideal for writ-

ing simple apps because you won't have to pay much attention to managing   
the database.

**N O T E**

*In an active virtual environment, use the command*

*python*

*to run*

*manage.py*

*com-*

*mands, even if you use something different, like*

*python3*

*, to run other programs. In*

*a virtual environment, the command*

*python*

*refers to the version of Python that was*

*used to create the virtual environment.*

***Viewing the Project***

Let's make sure that Django has set up the project properly. Enter the

**runserver**

command to view the project in its current state:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py runserver**

Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Django should start a server called the *development server*, so you can

view the project on your system to see how well it works. When you request   
a page by entering a URL in a browser, the Django server responds to that   
request by building the appropriate page and sending it to the browser.

Django first checks to make sure the project is set up properly

1

; it

then reports the version of Django in use and the name of the settings file   
in use

2

. Finally, it reports the URL where the project is being served

3

.

The URL *http://127.0.0.1:8000/* indicates that the project is listening for   
requests on port 8000 on your computer, which is called a localhost. The  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress416.png)

**378**

Chapter 18

term *localhost* refers to a server that only processes requests on your system;   
it doesn't allow anyone else to see the pages you're developing.

Open a web browser and enter the URL *http://localhost:8000/* , or *http://127*

*.0.0.1:8000/* if the first one doesn't work. You should see something like   
Figure 18-1: a page that Django creates to let you know everything is working   
properly so far. Keep the server running for now, but when you want to stop   
the server, press CTRL-C in the terminal where the

runserver

command was

issued.

*Figure 18-1: Everything is working so far.*

**N O T E**

*If you receive the error message "That port is already in use," tell Django to use a dif-*

*ferent port by entering*

***python manage.py runserver 8001***

*and then cycling through*

*higher numbers until you find an open port.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**18-1. New Projects:**

To get a better idea of what Django does, build a couple

empty projects and look at what Django creates. Make a new folder with a   
simple name, like

*tik_gram*

or

*insta_tok*

(outside of your

*learning_log*

directory),

navigate to that folder in a terminal, and create a virtual environment. Install   
Django and run the command

**django-admin.py startproject tg_project .**

(making sure to include the dot at the end of the command).

Look at the files and folders this command creates, and compare them to

Learning Log. Do this a few times, until you're familiar with what Django creates   
when starting a new project. Then delete the project directories if you wish.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress417.png)

Getting Started with Django

**379**

**Starting an App**

A Django *project* is organized as a group of individual *apps* that work together   
to make the project work as a whole. For now, we'll create one app to do   
most of our project's work. We'll add another app i[n Chapter 19](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#441) to manage   
user accounts.

You should leave the development server running in the terminal win-

dow you opened earlier. Open a new terminal window (or tab) and navigate   
to the directory that contains *manage.py* . Activate the virtual environment,   
and then run the

**startapp**

command:

learning_log$

**source ll_env/bin/activate**

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py startapp learning_logs**

1

(ll_env)learning_log$

**ls**

db.sqlite3 learning_logs ll_env ll_project manage.py

2

(ll_env)learning_log$

**ls learning_logs/**

__init__.py admin.py apps.py migrations models.py tests.py views.py

The command

startapp

*appname*

tells Django to create the infrastructure

needed to build an app. When you look in the project directory now, you'll   
see a new folder called *learning_logs*

1

. Use the

**ls**

command to see what

Django has created

2

. The most important files are *models.py* , *admin.py*, and

*views.py* . We'll use *models.py* to define the data we want to manage in our   
app. We'll look at *admin.py* and *views.py* a little later.

***Defining Models***

Let's think about our data for a moment. Each user will need to create a   
number of topics in their learning log. Each entry they make will be tied to a   
topic, and these entries will be displayed as text. We'll also need to store the   
timestamp of each entry so we can show users when they made each one.

Open the file *models.py* and look at its existing content:

*models.py*

from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

A module called

models

is being imported, and we're being invited to

create models of our own. A *model* tells Django how to work with the data   
that will be stored in the app. A model is a class; it has attributes and meth-  
ods, just like every class we've discussed. Here's the model for the topics   
users will store:

from django.db import models

class Topic(models.Model):  
"""A topic the user is learning about."""

1

text = models.CharField(max_length=200)

2

date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress418.png)

**380**

Chapter 18

3

def __str__(self):

"""Return a string representation of the model."""  
return self.text

We've created a class called

Topic

, which inherits from

Model

---a parent

class included in Django that defines a model's basic functionality. We add   
two attributes to the

Topic

class:

text

and

date_added

.

The

text

attribute is a

CharField

, a piece of data that's made up of char-

acters or text

1

. You use

CharField

when you want to store a small amount of

text, such as a name, a title, or a city. When we define a

CharField

attribute,

we have to tell Django how much space it should reserve in the database.   
Here we give it a

max_length

of

200

characters, which should be enough to

hold most topic names.

The

date_added

attribute is a

DateTimeField

, a piece of data that will

record a date and time

2

. We pass the argument

auto_now_add=True

, which

tells Django to automatically set this attribute to the current date and time   
whenever the user creates a new topic.

It's a good idea to tell Django how you want it to represent an instance

of a model. If a model has a

__str__()

method, Django calls that method

whenever it needs to generate output referring to an instance of that model.   
Here we've written a

__str__()

method that returns the value assigned to the

text

attribute

3

.

To see the different kinds of fields you can use in a model, see the

"Model Field Reference" page a[t *https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/
models/fields*. Y](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields)ou won't need all the information right now, but it will be   
extremely useful when you're developing your own Django projects.

***Activating Models***

To use our models, we have to tell Django to include our app in the overall   
project. Open *settings.py* (in the *ll_project* directory); you'll see a section that   
tells Django which apps are installed in the project:

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

INSTALLED_APPS = \[  
'django.contrib.admin',  
'django.contrib.auth',  
'django.contrib.contenttypes',  
'django.contrib.sessions',  
'django.contrib.messages',  
'django.contrib.staticfiles',  
\]

*--snip--*

Add our app to this list by modifying

INSTALLED_APPS

so it looks like this:

*--snip--*

INSTALLED_APPS = \[

# My apps.  
'learning_logs',  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress419.png)

Getting Started with Django

**381**

# Default django apps.

'django.contrib.admin',  

*--snip--*

\]

*--snip--*

Grouping apps together in a project helps keep track of them as the

project grows to include more apps. Here we start a section called

My apps

,

which includes only

'learning_logs'

for now. It's important to place your own

apps before the default apps, in case you need to override any behavior of   
the default apps with your own custom behavior.

Next, we need to tell Django to modify the database so it can store

information related to the model

Topic

. From the terminal, run the follow-

ing command:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs**

Migrations for 'learning_logs':  
learning_logs/migrations/0001_initial.py  
- Create model Topic  
(ll_env)learning_log$

The command

makemigrations

tells Django to figure out how to modify

the database so it can store the data associated with any new models we've   
defined. The output here shows that Django has created a migration file   
called *0001_initial.py*. This migration will create a table for the model

Topic

in the database.

Now we'll apply this migration and have Django modify the database

for us:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py migrate**

Operations to perform:  
Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, learning_logs, sessions  
Running migrations:  
Applying learning_logs.0001_initial... OK

Most of the output from this command is identical to the output from

the first time we issued the

migrate

command. We need to check the last line

in this output, where Django confirms that the migration for

learning_logs

worked

OK

.

Whenever we want to modify the data that Learning Log manages, we'll

follow these three steps: modify *models.py*, call

makemigrations

on

learning_logs

,

and tell Django to

migrate

the project.

***The Django Admin Site***

Django makes it easy to work with your models through its admin site. Django's   
*admin site* is only meant to be used by the site's administrators; it's not meant for   
regular users. In this section, we'll set up the admin site and use it to add some   
topics through the

Topic

model.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress420.png)

**382**

Chapter 18

**Setting Up a Superuser**

Django allows you to create a *superuser* , a user who has all privileges avail-  
able on the site. A user's *privileges* control the actions they can take. The   
most restrictive privilege settings allow a user to only read public informa-  
tion on the site. Registered users typically have the privilege of reading   
their own private data and some selected information available only to   
members. To effectively administer a project, the site owner usually needs   
access to all information stored on the site. A good administrator is careful   
with their users' sensitive information, because users put a lot of trust into   
the apps they access.

To create a superuser in Django, enter the following command and

respond to the prompts:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py createsuperuser**

1

Username (leave blank to use 'eric'):

**ll_admin**

2

Email address:

3

Password:

Password (again):  
Superuser created successfully.  
(ll_env)learning_log$

When you issue the command

createsuperuser

, Django prompts you to

enter a username for the superuser

1

. Here I'm using

ll_admin

, but you can

enter any username you want. You can enter an email address or just leave   
this field blank

2

. You'll need to enter your password twice

3

.

**N O T E**

*Some sensitive information can be hidden from a site's administrators. For example,*

*Django doesn't store the password you enter; instead, it stores a string derived from
the password, called a* hash*. Each time you enter your password, Django hashes your
entry and compares it to the stored hash. If the two hashes match, you're authenti-
cated. By requiring hashes to match, Django ensures that if an attacker gains access to
a site's database, they'll be able to read the stored hashes but not the passwords. When
a site is set up properly, it's almost impossible to get the original passwords from the
hashes.*

**Registering a Model with the Admin Site**

Django includes some models in the admin site automatically, such as

User

and

Group

, but the models we create need to be added manually.

When we started the

learning_logs

app, Django created an *admin.py* file

in the same directory as *models.py* . Open the *admin.py* file:

*admin.py*

from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress421.png)

Getting Started with Django

**383**

To register

Topic

with the admin site, enter the following:

from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Topic

admin.site.register(Topic)

This code first imports the model we want to register,

Topic

. The dot

in front of

models

tells Django to look for *models.py* in the same directory as

*admin.py*. The code

admin.site.register()

tells Django to manage our model

through the admin site.

Now use the superuser account to access the admin site. Go to *http://*

*localhost:8000/admin/* and enter the username and password for the super-  
user you just created. You should see a screen similar to the one shown in   
Figure 18-2. This page allows you to add new users and groups, and change   
existing ones. You can also work with data related to the

Topic

model that

we just defined.

*Figure 18-2: The admin site with*

*Topic*

*included*

**N O T E**

*If you see a message in your browser that the web page is not available, make sure you*

*still have the Django server running in a terminal window. If you don't, activate a
virtual environment and reissue the command*

***python manage.py runserver***

*. If you're*

*having trouble viewing your project at any point in the development process, closing any
open terminals and reissuing the*

***runserver***

*command is a good first troubleshooting step.*

**Adding Topics**

Now that

Topic

has been registered with the admin site, let's add our first

topic. Click **Topics** to go to the Topics page, which is mostly empty, because   
we have no topics to manage yet. Click **Add Topic** , and a form for adding a   
new topic appears. Enter

**Chess**

in the first box and click **Save**. You'll be sent

back to the Topics admin page, and you'll see the topic you just created.

Let's create a second topic so we'll have more data to work with.

Click **Add Topic** again, and enter

**Rock Climbing**

. Click **Save**, and you'll be

sent back to the main Topics page again. Now you'll see Chess and Rock   
Climbing listed.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress422.png)

**384**

Chapter 18

***Defining the Entry Model***

For a user to record what they've been learning about chess and rock climb-  
ing, we need to define a model for the kinds of entries users can make in   
their learning logs. Each entry needs to be associated with a particular   
topic. This relationship is called a *many-to-one relationship* , meaning many   
entries can be associated with one topic.

Here's the code for the

Entry

model. Place it in your *models.py*file:

*models.py*

from django.db import models

class Topic(models.Model):  

*--snip--*

1

class Entry(models.Model):

"""Something specific learned about a topic."""

2

topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

3

text = models.TextField()

date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

4

class Meta:

verbose_name_plural = 'entries'

def __str__(self):  
"""Return a simple string representing the entry."""

5

return f"{self.text\[:50\]}..."

The

Entry

class inherits from Django's base

Model

class, just as

Topic

did

1

. The first attribute,

topic

, is a

ForeignKey

instance

2

. A *foreign key* is a

database term; it's a reference to another record in the database. This is the   
code that connects each entry to a specific topic. Each topic is assigned a   
*key* , or ID, when it's created. When Django needs to establish a connection   
between two pieces of data, it uses the keys associated with each piece of   
information. We'll use these connections shortly to retrieve all the entries   
associated with a certain topic. The

on_delete=models.CASCADE

argument tells

Django that when a topic is deleted, all the entries associated with that topic   
should be deleted as well. This is known as a *cascading delete*.

Next is an attribute called

text

, which is an instance of

TextField

3

.

This kind of field doesn't need a size limit, because we don't want to limit   
the size of individual entries. The

date_added

attribute allows us to present

entries in the order they were created, and to place a timestamp next to   
each entry.

The

Meta

class is nested inside the

Entry

class

4

. The

Meta

class holds

extra information for managing a model; here, it lets us set a special attri-  
bute telling Django to use

Entries

when it needs to refer to more than one

entry. Without this, Django would refer to multiple entries as

Entrys

.

The

__str__()

method tells Django which information to show when

it refers to individual entries. Because an entry can be a long body of text,

__str__()

returns just the first

50

characters of

text

5

. We also add an ellipsis

to clarify that we're not always displaying the entire entry.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress423.png)

Getting Started with Django

**385**

***Migrating the Entry Model***

Because we've added a new model, we need to migrate the database again.   
This process will become quite familiar: you modify *models.py* , run the com-  
mand

**python manage.py makemigrations**

***app_name***

, and then run the command

**python manage.py migrate**

.

Migrate the database and check the output by entering the following

commands:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs**

Migrations for 'learning_logs':

1

learning_logs/migrations/0002_entry.py

- Create model Entry  
(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py migrate**

Operations to perform:

*--snip--*

2

Applying learning_logs.0002_entry... OK

A new migration called *0002_entry.py* is generated, which tells Django

how to modify the database to store information related to the model

Entry

1

. When we issue the

migrate

command, we see that Django applied

this migration and everything worked properly

2

.

***Registering Entry with the Admin Site***

We also need to register the

Entry

model. Here's what *admin.py* should look

like now:

*admin.py*

from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Topic, Entry

admin.site.register(Topic)

admin.site.register(Entry)

Go back to *http://localhost/admin/*, and you should see Entries listed

under *Learning_Logs* . Click the **Add** link for Entries, or click **Entries** and   
then choose **Add entry** . You should see a drop-down list to select the topic   
you're creating an entry for and a text box for adding an entry. Select **Chess**   
from the drop-down list, and add an entry. Here's the first entry I made:

The opening is the first part of the game, roughly the first ten   
moves or so. In the opening, it's a good idea to do three things---  
bring out your bishops and knights, try to control the center of   
the board, and castle your king.  
Of course, these are just guidelines. It will be important to learn   
when to follow these guidelines and when to disregard these   
suggestions.

When you click **Save**, you'll be brought back to the main admin page

for entries. Here, you'll see the benefit of using

resentation for each entry; it's much easier to work with multiple entries in

the admin interface if you see only the first part of an entry, rather than the   
entire text of each entry.

Make a second entry for Chess and one entry for Rock Climbing so we

have some initial data. Here's a second entry for Chess:

In the opening phase of the game, it's important to bring out   
your bishops and knights. These pieces are powerful and maneu-  
verable enough to play a significant role in the beginning moves   
of a game.

And here's a first entry for Rock Climbing:

One of the most important concepts in climbing is to keep your   
weight on your feet as much as possible. There's a myth that   
climbers can hang all day on their arms. In reality, good climb-  
ers have practiced specific ways of keeping their weight over their   
feet whenever possible.

These three entries will give us something to work with as we continue

to develop Learning Log.

***The Django Shell***

Now that we've entered some data, we can examine it programmatically   
through an interactive terminal session. This interactive environment is   
called the Django *shell* , and it's a great environment for testing and trouble-  
shooting your project. Here's an example of an interactive shell session:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py shell**

1

\>\>\>

**from learning_logs.models import Topic**

\>\>\>

**Topic.objects.all()**

\<QuerySet \[\<Topic: Chess\>, \<Topic: Rock Climbing\>\]\>

The command

python manage.py shell

, run in an active virtual environ-

ment, launches a Python interpreter that you can use to explore the data   
stored in your project's database. Here, we import the model

Topic

from

the

learning_logs.models

module

1

. We then use the method

Topic.objects

.all()

to get all instances of the model

Topic

; the list that's returned is

called a *queryset*.

We can loop over a queryset just as we'd loop over a list. Here's how you

can see the ID that's been assigned to each topic object:

\>\>\>

**topics = Topic.objects.all()**

\>\>\>

**for topic in topics:**

...

**print(topic.id, topic)**

...  
1 Chess  
2 Rock Climbing

We assign the queryset to

topics

and then print each topic's

id

attribute

and the string representation of each topic. We can see that

Chess

has an ID

of

1

and

Rock Climbing

has an ID of

2

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress425.png)

Getting Started with Django

**387**

If you know the ID of a particular object, you can use the method

Topic

.objects.get()

to retrieve that object and examine any attribute the object

has. Let's look at the

text

and

date_added

values for

Chess

:

\>\>\>

**t = Topic.objects.get(id=1)**

\>\>\>

**t.text**

'Chess'  
\>\>\>

**t.date_added**

datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 20, 3, 33, 36, 928759,  
tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)

We can also look at the entries related to a certain topic. Earlier, we

defined the

topic

attribute for the

Entry

model. This was a

ForeignKey

, a con-

nection between each entry and a topic. Django can use this connection to   
get every entry related to a certain topic, like this:

1

\>\>\>

**t.entry_set.all()**

\<QuerySet \[\<Entry: The opening is the first part of the game, roughly...\>,   
\<Entry:  
In the opening phase of the game, it's important t...\>\]\>

To get data through a foreign key relationship, you use the lowercase

name of the related model followed by an underscore and the word

set

1

.

For example, say you have the models

Pizza

and

Topping

, and

Topping

is

related to

Pizza

through a foreign key. If your object is called

my_pizza

, repre-

senting a single pizza, you can get all of the pizza's toppings using the code

my_pizza.topping_set.all()

.

We'll use this syntax when we begin to code the pages users can

request. The shell is really useful for making sure your code retrieves the   
data you want it to. If your code works as you expect it to in the shell, it   
should also work properly in the files within your project. If your code gen-  
erates errors or doesn't retrieve the data you expect it to, it's much easier   
to troubleshoot your code in the simple shell environment than within the   
files that generate web pages. We won't refer to the shell much, but you   
should continue using it to practice working with Django's syntax for access-  
ing the data stored in the project.

Each time you modify your models, you'll need to restart the shell to

see the effects of those changes. To exit a shell session, press CTRL-D; on   
Windows, press CTRL-Z and then press ENTER.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

The

__str__()

method in the

model currently appends

an ellipsis to every instance of

when Django shows it in the admin site

or the shell. Add an

statement to the

__str__()

method that adds an ellipsis

only if the entry is longer than 50 characters. Use the admin site to add an   
entry that's fewer than 50 characters in length, and check that it doesn't have   
an ellipsis when viewed.

**18-3. The Django API:**

When you write code to access the data in your project,

you're writing a

*query*

. Skim through the documentation for querying your data

a[t](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries)

[*https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries*](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries)*.*

Much of what you

see will look new to you, but it will be quite useful as you start to work on your   
own projects.

**18-4. Pizzeria:**

Start a new project called

pizzeria_project

with an app called

pizzas

. Define a model

Pizza

with a field called

name

, which will hold name

values, such as

Hawaiian

and

Meat Lovers

. Define a model called

Topping

with

fields called

pizza

and

name

. The

pizza

field should be a foreign key to

Pizza

,

and

name

should be able to hold values such as

pineapple

,

Canadian bacon

, and

sausage

.

Register both models with the admin site, and use the site to enter some

pizza names and toppings. Use the shell to explore the data you entered.

**Making Pages: The Learning Log Home Page**

Making web pages with Django consists of three stages: defining URLs,   
writing views, and writing templates. You can do these in any order, but in   
this project we'll always start by defining the URL pattern. A *URL pattern*   
describes the way the URL is laid out. It also tells Django what to look for   
when matching a browser request with a site URL, so it knows which page   
to return.

Each URL then maps to a particular view. The *view* function retrieves

and processes the data needed for that page. The view function often ren-  
ders the page using a *template* , which contains the overall structure of the   
page. To see how this works, let's make the home page for Learning Log.   
We'll define the URL for the home page, write its view function, and create   
a simple template.

Because we just want to ensure that Learning Log works as it's supposed

to, we'll make a simple page for now. A functioning web app is fun to style   
when it's complete; an app that looks good but doesn't work well is point-  
less. For now, the home page will display only a title and a brief description.

***Mapping a URL***

Users request pages by entering URLs into a browser and clicking links, so   
we'll need to decide what URLs are needed. The home page URL is first:   
it's the base URL people use to access the project. At the moment, the base   
URL, *http://localhost:8000/* , returns the default Django site that lets us know   
the project was set up correctly. We'll change this by mapping the base URL   
to Learning Log's home page.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress427.png)

Getting Started with Django

**389**

In the main *ll_project* folder, open the file *urls.py*. You should see the fol-

lowing code:

*ll_project/*

*urls.py*

1

from django.contrib import admin

from django.urls import path

2

urlpatterns = \[

3

path('admin/', admin.site.urls),

\]

The first two lines import the

admin

module and a function to build URL

paths

1

. The body of the file defines the

urlpatterns

variable

2

. In this *urls.py*

file, which defines URLs for the project as a whole, the

urlpatterns

variable

includes sets of URLs from the apps in the project. The list includes the   
module

admin.site.urls

, which defines all the URLs that can be requested

from the admin site

3

.

We need to include the URLs for

learning_logs

, so add the following:

from django.contrib import admin

from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = \[  
path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  

path('', include('learning_logs.urls')),

\]

We've imported the

include()

function, and we've also added a line to

include the module

learning_logs.urls

.

The default *urls.py* is in the *ll_project*folder; now we need to make a sec-

ond *urls.py* file in the *learning_logs* folder. Create a new Python file, save it as   
*urls.py* in *learning_logs*, and enter this code into it:

*learning_logs/*

*urls.py*

1

"""Defines URL patterns for learning_logs."""

2

from django.urls import path

3

from . import views

4

app_name = 'learning_logs'

5

urlpatterns = \[

# Home page

6

path('', views.index, name='index'),

\]

To make it clear which *urls.py* we're working in, we add a docstring at

the beginning of the file

1

. We then import the

path

function, which is

needed when mapping URLs to views

2

. We also import the

views

mod-

ule

3

; the dot tells Python to import the *views.py* module from the same

directory as the current *urls.py* module. The variable

app_name

helps Django

distinguish this *urls.py* file from files of the same name in other apps within   
the project

4

. The variable

urlpatterns

in this module is a list of individual

pages that can be requested from the

learning_logs

app

5

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress428.png)

**390**

Chapter 18

The actual URL pattern is a call to the

path()

function, which takes

three arguments

6

. The first argument is a string that helps Django route

the current request properly. Django receives the requested URL and tries   
to route the request to a view. It does this by searching all the URL patterns   
we've defined to find one that matches the current request. Django ignores   
the base URL for the project (*http://localhost:8000/* ), so the empty string   
(

''

) matches the base URL. Any other URL won't match this pattern, and

Django will return an error page if the URL requested doesn't match any   
existing URL patterns.

The second argument in

path()

6

specifies which function to call

in *views.py* . When a requested URL matches the pattern we're defining,   
Django calls the

index()

function from *views.py*. (We'll write this view func-

tion in the next section.) The third argument provides the name *index* for   
this URL pattern so we can refer to it more easily in other files throughout   
the project. Whenever we want to provide a link to the home page, we'll use   
this name instead of writing out a URL.

***Writing a View***

A view function takes in information from a request, prepares the data   
needed to generate a page, and then sends the data back to the browser. It   
often does this by using a template that defines what the page will look like.

The file *views.py* in *learning_logs* was generated automatically when we ran

the command

python manage.py startapp

. Here's what's in *views.py* right now:

*views.py*

from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.

Currently, this file just imports the

render()

function, which renders the

response based on the data provided by views. Open *views.py* and add the   
following code for the home page:

from django.shortcuts import render

def index(request):  
"""The home page for Learning Log."""  
return render(request, 'learning_logs/index.html')

When a URL request matches the pattern we just defined, Django looks

for a function called

index()

in the *views.py*file. Django then passes the

request

object to this view function. In this case, we don't need to process any

data for the page, so the only code in the function is a call to

render()

. The

render()

function here passes two arguments: the original

request

object and

a template it can use to build the page. Let's write this template.

***Writing a Template***

The template defines what the page should look like, and Django fills in   
the relevant data each time the page is requested. A template allows you to  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress429.png)

Getting Started with Django

**391**

access any data provided by the view. Because our view for the home page   
provides no data, this template is fairly simple.

Inside the *learning_logs* folder, make a new folder called *templates*.

Inside the *templates* folder, make another folder called *learning_logs* . This   
might seem a little redundant (we have a folder named *learning_logs* inside a   
folder named *templates* inside a folder named *learning_logs* ), but it sets up a   
structure that Django can interpret unambiguously, even in the context of a   
large project containing many individual apps. Inside the inner *learning_logs*   
folder, make a new file called *index.html* . The path to the file will be *ll_project/
learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/index.html* . Enter the following code into   
that file:

*index.html*

\<p\>Learning Log\</p\>

\<p\>Learning Log helps you keep track of your learning, for any topic you're  
interested in.\</p\>

This is a very simple file. If you're not familiar with HTML, the

\<p\>\</p\>

tags signify paragraphs. The

\<p\>

tag opens a paragraph, and the

\</p\>

tag

closes a paragraph. We have two paragraphs: the first acts as a title, and the   
second describes what users can do with Learning Log.

Now when you request the project's base URL, *http://localhost:8000/*, you

should see the page we just built instead of the default Django page. Django   
will take the requested URL, and that URL will match the pattern

''

; then

Django will call the function

views.index()

, which will render the page using

the template contained in *index.html*. Figure 18-3 shows the resulting page.

*Figure 18-3: The home page for Learning Log*

Although it might seem like a complicated process for creating one

page, this separation between URLs, views, and templates works quite well. It   
allows you to think about each aspect of a project separately. In larger proj-  
ects, it allows individuals working on the project to focus on the areas in   
which they're strongest. For example, a database specialist can focus on the   
models, a programmer can focus on the view code, and a frontend special-  
ist can focus on the templates.

Consider an app that helps people plan their meals

throughout the week. Make a new folder called

*meal_planner*

, and start

a new Django project inside this folder. Then make a new app called

meal

_plans

. Make a simple home page for this project.

**18-6. Pizzeria Home Page:**

Add a home page to the Pizzeria project you

started in [Exercise 18-4 (page 388)](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#426).

**Building Additional Pages**

Now that we've established a routine for building a page, we can start to   
build out the Learning Log project. We'll build two pages that display data:   
a page that lists all topics and a page that shows all the entries for a particu-  
lar topic. For each page, we'll specify a URL pattern, write a view function,   
and write a template. But before we do this, we'll create a base template   
that all templates in the project can inherit from.

***Template Inheritance***

When building a website, some elements will need to be repeated on each   
page. Rather than writing these elements directly into each page, you can   
write a base template containing the repeated elements and then have each   
page inherit from the base. This approach lets you focus on developing the   
unique aspects of each page, and makes it much easier to change the over-  
all look and feel of the project.

**The Parent Template**

We'll create a template called *base.html* in the same directory as *index.html* .   
This file will contain elements common to all pages; every other template   
will inherit from *base.html* . The only element we want to repeat on each   
page right now is the title at the top. Because we'll include this template   
on every page, let's make the title a link to the home page:

*base.html*

\<p\>

1

\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}"\>Learning Log\</a\>  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress431.png)

Getting Started with Django

**393**

\</p\>

2

{% block content %}{% endblock content %}

The first part of this file creates a paragraph containing the name of

the project, which also acts as a home page link. To generate a link, we use   
a *template tag*, which is indicated by braces and percent signs (

{% %}

). A tem-

plate tag generates information to be displayed on a page. The template   
tag

{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}

shown here generates a URL matching

the URL pattern defined in *learning_logs/urls.py* with the name

'index'

1

. In

this example,

learning_logs

is the *namespace* and

index

is a uniquely named

URL pattern in that namespace. The namespace comes from the value we   
assigned to

app_name

in the *learning_logs/urls.py* file.

In a simple HTML page, a link is surrounded by the *anchor* *tag*

\<a\>

:

\<a href="

*link_url*

"\>

*link text*

\</a\>

Having the template tag generate the URL for us makes it much easier

to keep our links up to date. We only need to change the URL pattern in   
*urls.py* , and Django will automatically insert the updated URL the next time   
the page is requested. Every page in our project will inherit from *base.html* ,   
so from now on, every page will have a link back to the home page.

On the last line, we insert a pair of

block

tags

2

. This block, named

content

,

is a placeholder; the child template will define the kind of information that   
goes in the

content

block.

A child template doesn't have to define every block from its parent, so

you can reserve space in parent templates for as many blocks as you like; the   
child template uses only as many as it needs.

**N O T E**

*In Python code, we almost always use four spaces when we indent. Template files tend*

*to have more levels of nesting than Python files, so it's common to use only two spaces
for each indentation level.*

**The Child Template**

Now we need to rewrite *index.html* to inherit from *base.html* . Add the follow-  
ing code to *index.html*:

*index.html*

1

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

2

{% block content %}

\<p\>Learning Log helps you keep track of your learning, for any topic you're  
interested in.\</p\>

3

{% endblock content %}

If you compare this to the original *index.html*, you can see that we've

replaced the Learning Log title with the code for inheriting from a parent   
template

1

. A child template must have an

{% extends %}

tag on the first

line to tell Django which parent template to inherit from. The file *base.html*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress432.png)

**394**

Chapter 18

is part of

learning_logs

, so we include *learning_logs* in the path to the parent

template. This line pulls in everything contained in the *base.html* template   
and allows *index.html* to define what goes in the space reserved by the

content

block.

We define the content block by inserting a

{% block %}

tag with the

name

content

2

. Everything that we aren't inheriting from the parent tem-

plate goes inside the

content

block. Here, that's the paragraph describing

the Learning Log project. We indicate that we're finished defining the con-  
tent by using an

{% endblock content %}

tag

3

. The

{% endblock %}

tag doesn't

require a name, but if a template grows to contain multiple blocks, it can be   
helpful to know exactly which block is ending.

You can start to see the benefit of template inheritance: in a child

template, we only need to include content that's unique to that page. This   
not only simplifies each template, but also makes it much easier to modify   
the site. To modify an element common to many pages, you only need to   
modify the parent template. Your changes are then carried over to every   
page that inherits from that template. In a project that includes tens or   
hundreds of pages, this structure can make it much easier and faster to   
improve your site.

In a large project, it's common to have one parent template called *base*

*.html* for the entire site and parent templates for each major section of the   
site. All the section templates inherit from *base.html* , and each page in   
the site inherits from a section template. This way you can easily modify the   
look and feel of the site as a whole, any section in the site, or any individual   
page. This configuration provides a very efficient way to work, and encour-  
ages you to steadily update your project over time.

***The Topics Page***

Now that we have an efficient approach to building pages, we can focus on   
our next two pages: the general topics page and the page to display entries   
for a single topic. The topics page will show all topics that users have cre-  
ated, and it's the first page that will involve working with data.

**The Topics URL Pattern**

First, we define the URL for the topics page. It's common to choose a sim-  
ple URL fragment that reflects the kind of information presented on the   
page. We'll use the word *topics* , so the URL *http://localhost:8000/topics/* will   
return this page. Here's how we modify *learning_logs/urls.py*:

*learning_logs/*

*urls.py*

"""Defines URL patterns for learning_logs."""

*--snip--*

urlpatterns = \[  
# Home page  
path('', views.index, name='index'),

# Page that shows all topics.  
path('topics/', views.topics, name='topics'),

\]  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress433.png)

Getting Started with Django

**395**

The new URL pattern is the word *topics*, followed by a forward slash.

When Django examines a requested URL, this pattern will match any URL   
that has the base URL followed by *topics* . You can include or omit a forward   
slash at the end, but there can't be anything else after the word *topics* , or the   
pattern won't match. Any request with a URL that matches this pattern will   
then be passed to the function

topics()

in *views.py*.

**The Topics View**

The

topics()

function needs to retrieve some data from the database and

send it to the template. Add the following to *views.py*:

*views.py*

from django.shortcuts import render

1

from .models import Topic

def index(request):  

*--snip--*

2

def topics(request):

"""Show all topics."""

3

topics = Topic.objects.order_by('date_added')

4

context = {'topics': topics}

5

return render(request, 'learning_logs/topics.html', context)

We first import the model associated with the data we need

1

. The

topics()

function needs one parameter: the

request

object Django received

from the server

2

. We query the database by asking for the

Topic

objects,

sorted by the

date_added

attribute

3

. We assign the resulting queryset to

topics

.

We then define a context that we'll send to the template

4

. A *context* is

a dictionary in which the keys are names we'll use in the template to access   
the data we want, and the values are the data we need to send to the tem-  
plate. In this case, there's one key-value pair, which contains the set of topics   
we'll display on the page. When building a page that uses data, we call

render()

with the

request

object, the template we want to use, and the

context

dictionary

5

.

**The Topics Template**

The template for the topics page receives the

context

dictionary, so the tem-

plate can use the data that

topics()

provides. Make a file called *topics.html* in

the same directory as *index.html* . Here's how we can display the topics in the   
template:

*topics.html*

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

{% block content %}

\<p\>Topics\</p\>  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress434.png)

\<li\>No topics have been added yet.\</li\>

5

{% endfor %}

6

\</ul\>

{% endblock content %}

We use the

{% extends %}

tag to inherit from *base.html*, just as we did on

the home page, and then we open a

content

block. The body of this page

contains a bulleted list of the topics that have been entered. In standard   
HTML, a bulleted list is called an *unordered list* and is indicated by the tags

\<ul\>\</ul\>

. The opening tag

\<ul\>

begins the bulleted list of topics

1

.

Next we use a template tag that's equivalent to a

for

loop, which loops

through the list

topics

from the

context

dictionary

2

. The code used in tem-

plates differs from Python in some important ways. Python uses indentation   
to indicate which lines of a

for

statement are part of a loop. In a template,

every

for

loop needs an explicit

{% endfor %}

tag indicating where the end of

the loop occurs. So in a template, you'll see loops written like this:

{% for

*item*

in

*list*

%}

*do something with each item*

{% endfor %}

Inside the loop, we want to turn each topic into an item in the bulleted

list. To print a variable in a template, wrap the variable name in double   
braces. The braces won't appear on the page; they just indicate to Django   
that we're using a template variable. So the code

{{ topic.text }}

3

will

be replaced by the value of the current topic's

text

attribute on each pass

through the loop. The HTML tag

\<li\>\</li\>

indicates a *list item*. Anything

between these tags, inside a pair of

\<ul\>\</ul\>

tags, will appear as a bulleted

item in the list.

We also use the

{% empty %}

template tag

4

, which tells Django what to

do if there are no items in the list. In this case, we print a message inform-  
ing the user that no topics have been added yet. The last two lines close out   
the

for

loop

5

and then close out the bulleted list

6

.

Now we need to modify the base template to include a link to the topics

page. Add the following code to *base.html*:

*base.html*

\<p\>

1

\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}"\>Learning Log\</a\> -

2

\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topics' %}"\>Topics\</a\>

\</p\>

{% block content %}{% endblock content %}

We add a dash after the link to the home page

1

, and then add a link

to the topics page using the

{% url %}

template tag again

2

. This line tells

Getting Started with Django

**397**

Django to generate a link matching the URL pattern with the name

'topics'

in *learning_logs/urls.py*.

Now when you refresh the home page in your browser, you'll see a

Topics link. When you click the link, you'll see a page that looks similar to   
Figure 18-4.

*Figure 18-4: The topics page*

***Individual Topic Pages***

Next, we need to create a page that can focus on a single topic, showing the   
topic name and all the entries for that topic. We'll define a new URL pat-  
tern, write a view, and create a template. We'll also modify the topics page   
so each item in the bulleted list links to its corresponding topic page.

**The Topic URL Pattern**

The URL pattern for the topic page is a little different from the prior   
URL patterns because it will use the topic's

id

attribute to indicate which

topic was requested. For example, if the user wants to see the detail page   
for the Chess topic (where the

id

is 1), the URL will be *http://localhost:*

*8000/topics/1/* . Here's a pattern to match this URL, which you should place   
in *learning_logs/urls.py*:

*learning_logs/*

*urls.py*

*--snip--*

urlpatterns = \[  

*--snip--*

# Detail page for a single topic.  
path('topics/\<int:topic_id\>/', views.topic, name='topic'),

\]

Let's examine the string

'topics/\<int:topic_id\>/'

in this URL pattern.

The first part of the string tells Django to look for URLs that have the word   
*topics* after the base URL. The second part of the string,

/\<int:topic_id\>/

,

matches an integer between two forward slashes and assigns the integer   
value to an argument called

topic_id

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress436.png)

**398**

Chapter 18

When Django finds a URL that matches this pattern, it calls the view

function

topic()

with the value assigned to

topic_id

as an argument. We'll

use the value of

topic_id

to get the correct topic inside the function.

**The Topic View**

The

topic()

function needs to get the topic and all associated entries from

the database, much like what we did earlier in the Django shell:

*views.py*

*--snip--*

1

def topic(request, topic_id):

"""Show a single topic and all its entries."""

2

topic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id)

3

entries = topic.entry_set.order_by('-date_added')

4

context = {'topic': topic, 'entries': entries}

5

return render(request, 'learning_logs/topic.html', context)

This is the first view function that requires a parameter other than the

request

object. The function accepts the value captured by the expression

/\<int:topic_id\>/

and assigns it to

topic_id

1

. Then we use

get()

to retrieve

the topic, just as we did in the Django shell

2

. Next, we get all of the entries

associated with this topic and order them according to

date_added

3

. The

minus sign in front of

date_added

sorts the results in reverse order, which will

display the most recent entries first. We store the topic and entries in the

context

dictionary

4

and call

render()

with the

request

object, the *topic.html*

template, and the

context

dictionary

5

.

**N O T E**

*The code phrases at*

2

*and*

3

*are called* queries*, because they query the database for*

*specific information. When you're writing queries like these in your own projects, it's
helpful to try them out in the Django shell first. You'll get much quicker feedback in
the shell than you would by writing a view and template and then checking the results
in a browser.*

**The Topic Template**

The template needs to display the name of the topic and the entries. We also   
need to inform the user if no entries have been made yet for this topic.

*topic.html*

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

{% block content %}

1

\<p\>Topic: {{ topic.text }}\</p\>

\<p\>Entries:\</p\>

2

\<ul\>

3

{% for entry in entries %}

\<li\>

4

\<p\>{{ entry.date_added\|date:'M d, Y H:i' }}\</p\>

5

\<p\>{{ entry.text\|linebreaks }}\</p\>

\</li\>

6

{% empty %}  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress437.png)

Getting Started with Django

**399**

\<li\>There are no entries for this topic yet.\</li\>  
{% endfor %}  
\</ul\>

{% endblock content %}

We extend *base.html*, as we'll do for all pages in the project. Next, we

show the

text

attribute of the topic that's been requested

1

. The vari-

able

topic

is available because it's included in the

context

dictionary. We

then start a bulleted list

2

to show each of the entries and loop through

them

3

, as we did with the topics earlier.

Each bullet lists two pieces of information: the timestamp and the full

text of each entry. For the timestamp

4

, we display the value of the attribute

date_added

. In Django templates, a vertical line (

\|

) represents a template *filter*---

a function that modifies the value in a template variable during the rendering   
process. The filter

date:'M d, Y H:i'

displays timestamps in the format *January 1,*

*2022 23:00*. The next line displays the value of the current entry's

text

attri-

bute. The filter

linebreaks

5

ensures that long text entries include line breaks

in a format understood by browsers, rather than showing a block of uninter-  
rupted text. We again use the

{% empty %}

template tag

6

to print a message

informing the user that no entries have been made.

**Links from the Topics Page**

Before we look at the topic page in a browser, we need to modify the topics   
template so each topic links to the appropriate page. Here's the change you   
need to make to *topics.html*:

*topics.html*

*--snip--*

{% for topic in topics %}

\<li\>  
\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topic' topic.id %}"\>  
{{ topic.text }}\</a\>\</li\>  
\</li\>

{% empty %}

*--snip--*

We use the URL template tag to generate the proper link, based on

the URL pattern in

learning_logs

with the name

'topic'

. This URL pattern

requires a

topic_id

argument, so we add the attribute

topic.id

to the URL

template tag. Now each topic in the list of topics is a link to a topic page,   
such as *http://localhost:8000/topics/1/*.

When you refresh the topics page and click a topic, you should see a

page that looks like Figure 18-5.

**N O T E**

*There's a subtle but important difference between*

*topic.id*

*and*

*topic_id*

*. The expres-*

*sion*

*topic.id*

*examines a topic and retrieves the value of the corresponding ID. The*

*variable*

*topic_id*

*is a reference to that ID in the code. If you run into errors when*

*working with IDs, make sure you're using these expressions in the appropriate ways.*

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how to start building a simple web app using   
the Django framework. You saw a brief project specification, installed   
Django to a virtual environment, set up a project, and checked that the   
project was set up correctly. You set up an app and defined models to rep-  
resent the data for your app. You learned about databases and how Django   
helps you migrate your database after you make a change to your models.   
You created a superuser for the admin site, and you used the admin site to   
enter some initial data.

You also explored the Django shell, which allows you to work with your

project's data in a terminal session. You learned how to define URLs, cre-  
ate view functions, and write templates to make pages for your site. You also   
used template inheritance to simplify the structure of individual templates   
and make it easier to modify the site as the project evolves.

Getting Started with Django

**401**

In [Chapter 19](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#441), you'll make intuitive, user-friendly pages that allow

users to add new topics and entries and edit existing entries without going   
through the admin site. You'll also add a user registration system, allow-  
ing users to create an account and make their own learning log. This is the   
heart of a web app---the ability to create something that any number of   
users can interact with.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress440.png)

**19**

**U S E R A C C O U N T S**

At the heart of a web application is the abil-

ity for any user, anywhere in the world, to

register an account with your app and start

using it. In this chapter, you'll build forms so

users can add their own topics and entries, and edit   
existing entries. You'll also learn how Django guards   
against common attacks against form-based pages, so   
you won't have to spend much time thinking about   
securing your apps.

You'll also implement a user authentication system. You'll build a regis-

tration page for users to create accounts, and then restrict access to certain   
pages to logged-in users only. Then you'll modify some of the view func-  
tions so users can only see their own data. You'll learn to keep your users'   
data safe and secure.

Chapter 19

**Allowing Users to Enter Data**

Before we build an authentication system for creating accounts, we'll first   
add some pages that allow users to enter their own data. We'll give users the   
ability to add a new topic, add a new entry, and edit their previous entries.

Currently, only a superuser can enter data through the admin site. We

don't want users to interact with the admin site, so we'll use Django's form-  
building tools to build pages that allow users to enter data.

***Adding New Topics***

Let's start by allowing users to add a new topic. Adding a form-based page   
works in much the same way as adding the pages we've already built: we   
define a URL, write a view function, and write a template. The one signifi-  
cant difference is the addition of a new module called *forms.py* , which will   
contain the forms.

**The Topic ModelForm**

Any page that lets a user enter and submit information on a web page involves   
an HTML element called a *form* . When users enter information, we need to   
*validate* that the information provided is the right kind of data and is not mali-  
cious, such as code designed to interrupt our server. We then need to process   
and save valid information to the appropriate place in the database. Django   
automates much of this work.

The simplest way to build a form in Django is to use a

ModelForm

, which

uses the information from the models we defined i[n Chapter 18 t](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#411)o build a   
form automatically. Write your first form in the file *forms.py* , which should   
be created in the same directory as *models.py*:

*forms.py*

from django import forms

from .models import Topic

1

class TopicForm(forms.ModelForm):

class Meta:

2

model = Topic

3

fields = \['text'\]

4

labels = {'text': ''}

We first import the

forms

module and the model we'll work with,

Topic

. We then define a class called

TopicForm

, which inherits from

forms

.ModelForm

1

.

The simplest version of a

ModelForm

consists of a nested

Meta

class telling

Django which model to base the form on and which fields to include in the   
form. Here we specify that the form should be based on the

Topic

model

2

,

and that it should only include the

text

field

3

. The empty string in the

labels dictionary tells Django not to generate a label for the

text

field

4

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress443.png)

User Accounts

**405**

**The new_topic URL**

The URL for a new page should be short and descriptive. When the   
user wants to add a new topic, we'll send them to *http://localhost:8000/
new_topic/*. Here's the URL pattern for the

new_topic

page; add this to

*learning_logs/urls.py*:

*learning_logs/*

*urls.py*

*--snip--*

urlpatterns = \[  

*--snip--*

# Page for adding a new topic.

path('new_topic/', views.new_topic, name='new_topic'),

\]

This URL pattern sends requests to the view function

new_topic()

, which

we'll write next.

**The new_topic() View Function**

The

new_topic()

function needs to handle two different situations: ini-

tial requests for the

new_topic

page, in which case it should show a blank

form; and the processing of any data submitted in the form. After data   
from a submitted form is processed, it needs to redirect the user back to   
the

topics

page:

*views.py*

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

from .models import Topic

from .forms import TopicForm

*--snip--*

def new_topic(request):  
"""Add a new topic."""

1

if request.method != 'POST':

# No data submitted; create a blank form.

2

form = TopicForm()

else:  
# POST data submitted; process data.

3

form = TopicForm(data=request.POST)

4

if form.is_valid():

5

form.save()

6

return redirect('learning_logs:topics')

# Display a blank or invalid form.

7

context = {'form': form}

return render(request, 'learning_logs/new_topic.html', context)

We import the function

redirect

, which we'll use to redirect the user

back to the

topics

page after they submit their topic. We also import the

form we just wrote,

TopicForm

.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress444.png)

**406**

Chapter 19

**GET and POST Requests**

The two main types of requests you'll use when building apps are GET and   
POST. You use *GET* requests for pages that only read data from the server.   
You usually use *POST* requests when the user needs to submit information   
through a form. We'll be specifying the POST method for processing all of   
our forms. (A few other kinds of requests exist, but we won't use them in   
this project.)

The

new_topic()

function takes in the

request

object as a parameter.

When the user initially requests this page, their browser will send a GET   
request. Once the user has filled out and submitted the form, their browser   
will submit a POST request. Depending on the request, we'll know whether   
the user is requesting a blank form (GET) or asking us to process a com-  
pleted form (POST).

We use an

if

test to determine whether the request method is GET or

POST

1

. If the request method isn't POST, the request is probably GET, so

we need to return a blank form. (If it's another kind of request, it's still safe   
to return a blank form.) We make an instance of

TopicForm

2

, assign it to

the variable

form

, and send the form to the template in the

context

diction-

ary

7

. Because we included no arguments when instantiating

TopicForm

,

Django creates a blank form that the user can fill out.

If the request method is POST, the

else

block runs and processes the

data submitted in the form. We make an instance of

TopicForm

3

and pass

it the data entered by the user, which is assigned to

request.POST

. The

form

object that's returned contains the information submitted by the user.

We can't save the submitted information in the database until we've

checked that it's valid

4

. The

is_valid()

method checks that all required

fields have been filled in (all fields in a form are required by default) and   
that the data entered matches the field types expected---for example, that   
the length of

text

is less than 200 characters, as we specified in *models.py* in

[Chapter 18. T](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#411)his automatic validation saves us a lot of work. If everything   
is valid, we can call

save()

5

, which writes the data from the form to the

database.

Once we've saved the data, we can leave this page. The

redirect()

func-

tion takes in the name of a view and redirects the user to the page associated   
with that view. Here we use

redirect()

to redirect the user's browser to the

topics

page

6

, where the user should see the topic they just entered in the list

of topics.

The

context

variable is defined at the end of the view function, and the

page is rendered using the template *new_topic.html* , which we'll create next.   
This code is placed outside of any

if

block; it will run if a blank form was

created, and it will run if a submitted form is determined to be invalid. An   
invalid form will include some default error messages to help the user sub-  
mit acceptable data.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress445.png)

**407**

**The new_topic Template**

Now we'll make a new template called *new_topic.html* to display the form we   
just created:

*new_topic.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

{% block content %}  
\<p\>Add a new topic:\</p\>

1

\<form action="{% url 'learning_logs:new_topic' %}" method='post'\>

2

{% csrf_token %}

3

{{ form.as_div }}

4

\<button name="submit"\>Add topic\</button\>

\</form\>

{% endblock content %}

This template extends *base.html*, so it has the same base structure as the

rest of the pages in Learning Log. We use the

\<form\>\</form\>

tags to define

an HTML form

1

. The

action

argument tells the browser where to send the

data submitted in the form; in this case, we send it back to the view function

new_topic()

. The

method

argument tells the browser to submit the data as a

POST request.

Django uses the template tag

{% csrf_token %}

2

to prevent attackers

from using the form to gain unauthorized access to the server. (This kind   
of attack is called a *cross-site request forgery* .) Next, we display the form; here   
you can see how simple Django can make certain tasks, such as displaying   
a form. We only need to include the template variable

{{ form.as_div }}

for Django to create all the fields necessary to display the form automati-  
cally

3

. The

as_div

modifier tells Django to render all the form elements as

HTML

\<div\>\</div\>

elements; this is a simple way to display the form neatly.

Django doesn't create a submit button for forms, so we define one before

closing the form

4

.

**Linking to the new_topic Page**

Next, we include a link to the

new_topic

page on the

topics

page:

*topics.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

{% block content %}

\<p\>Topics\</p\>

\<ul\>  

*--snip--*

\</ul\>

\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:new_topic' %}"\>Add a new topic\</a\>

{% endblock content %}  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress446.png)

**408**

Chapter 19

Place the link after the list of existing topics. Figure 19-1 shows the

resulting form; try using the form to add a few new topics of your own.

*Figure 19-1: The page for adding a new topic*

***Adding New Entries***

Now that the user can add a new topic, they'll want to add new entries too.   
We'll again define a URL, write a view function and a template, and link to   
the page. But first, we'll add another class to *forms.py*.

**The Entry ModelForm**

We need to create a form associated with the

Entry

model, but this time,

with a bit more customization than

TopicForm

:

*forms.py*

from django import forms

from .models import Topic, Entry

class TopicForm(forms.ModelForm):  

*--snip--*

class EntryForm(forms.ModelForm):  
class Meta:  
model = Entry  
fields = \['text'\]

1

labels = {'text': ''}

2

widgets = {'text': forms.Textarea(attrs={'cols': 80})}

We update the

import

statement to include

Entry

as well as

Topic

. We

make a new class called

EntryForm

that inherits from

forms.ModelForm

. The

EntryForm

class has a nested

Meta

class listing the model it's based on, and the

field to include in the form. We again give the field

'text'

a blank label

1

.

For

EntryForm

, we include the

widgets

attribute

2

. A *widget* is an HTML

form element, such as a single-line text box, multiline text area, or drop-  
down list. By including the

widgets

attribute, you can override Django's  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress447.png)

User Accounts

**409**

default widget choices. Here we're telling Django to use a

forms.Textarea

ele-

ment with a width of 80 columns, instead of the default 40 columns. This   
gives users enough room to write a meaningful entry.

**The new_entry URL**

New entries must be associated with a particular topic, so we need to include   
a

topic_id

argument in the URL for adding a new entry. Here's the URL,

which you add to *learning_logs/urls.py*:

*learning_logs/*

*urls.py*

*--snip--*

urlpatterns = \[  

*--snip--*

# Page for adding a new entry.  
path('new_entry/\<int:topic_id\>/', views.new_entry, name='new_entry'),

\]

This URL pattern matches any URL with the form *http://localhost:8000/*

*new_entry/id/*, where

*id*

is a number matching the topic ID. The code

\<int:topic_id\>

captures a numerical value and assigns it to the variable

topic_id

. When a URL matching this pattern is requested, Django sends the

request and the topic's ID to the

new_entry()

view function.

**The new_entry() View Function**

The view function for

new_entry

is much like the function for adding a new

topic. Add the following code to your *views.py* file:

*views.py*

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

from .models import Topic

from .forms import TopicForm, EntryForm

*--snip--*

def new_entry(request, topic_id):  
"""Add a new entry for a particular topic."""

1

topic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id)

2

if request.method != 'POST':

# No data submitted; create a blank form.

3

form = EntryForm()

else:  
# POST data submitted; process data.

4

form = EntryForm(data=request.POST)

if form.is_valid():

5

new_entry = form.save(commit=False)

6

new_entry.topic = topic

new_entry.save()

7

return redirect('learning_logs:topic', topic_id=topic_id)

# Display a blank or invalid form.  
context = {'topic': topic, 'form': form}  
return render(request, 'learning_logs/new_entry.html', context)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress448.png)

Chapter 19

We update the

import

statement to include the

EntryForm

we just made.

The definition of

new_entry()

has a

topic_id

parameter to store the value it

receives from the URL. We'll need the topic to render the page and process   
the form's data, so we use

topic_id

to get the correct topic object

1

.

Next, we check whether the request method is POST or GET

2

. The

if

block executes if it's a GET request, and we create a blank instance of

EntryForm

3

.

If the request method is POST, we process the data by making an instance

of

EntryForm

, populated with the POST data from the

request

object

4

. We

then check whether the form is valid. If it is, we need to set the entry object's

topic

attribute before saving it to the database. When we call

save()

, we include

the argument

commit=False

5

to tell Django to create a new entry object and

assign it to

new_entry

, without saving it to the database yet. We set the

topic

attribute of

new_entry

to the topic we pulled from the database at the begin-

ning of the function

6

. Then we call

save()

with no arguments, saving the

entry to the database with the correct associated topic.

The

redirect()

call requires two arguments: the name of the view we

want to redirect to and the argument that view function requires

7

. Here,

we're redirecting to

topic()

, which needs the argument

topic_id

. This view

then renders the topic page that the user made an entry for, and they   
should see their new entry in the list of entries.

At the end of the function, we create a

context

dictionary and render the

page using the *new_entry.html* template. This code will execute for a blank   
form, or for a form that's been submitted but turns out to be invalid.

**The new_entry Template**

As you can see in the following code, the template for

new_entry

is similar to

the template for

new_topic

:

*new_entry.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

{% block content %}

1

\<p\>\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topic' topic.id %}"\>{{ topic }}\</a\>\</p\>

\<p\>Add a new entry:\</p\>

2

\<form action="{% url 'learning_logs:new_entry' topic.id %}" method='post'\>

{% csrf_token %}  
{{ form.as_div }}  
\<button name='submit'\>Add entry\</button\>  
\</form\>

{% endblock content %}

We show the topic at the top of the page

1

, so the user can see which

topic they're adding an entry to. The topic also acts as a link back to the   
main page for that topic.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress449.png)

User Accounts

**411**

The form's

action

argument includes the

topic.id

value in the URL,

so the view function can associate the new entry with the correct topic

2

.

Other than that, this template looks just like *new_topic.html*.

**Linking to the new_entry Page**

Next, we need to include a link to the

new_entry

page from each topic page,

in the topic template:

*topic.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

{% block content %}

\<p\>Topic: {{ topic }}\</p\>

\<p\>Entries:\</p\>

\<p\>  
\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:new_entry' topic.id %}"\>Add new entry\</a\>  
\</p\>

\<ul\>  

*--snip--*

\</ul\>

{% endblock content %}

We place the link to add entries just before showing the entries,

because adding a new entry will be the most common action on this page.   
Figure 19-2 shows the

new_entry

page. Now users can add new topics and as

many entries as they want for each topic. Try out the

new_entry

page by add-

ing a few entries to some of the topics you've created.

*Figure 19-2: The*

*new_entry*

*page*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress450.png)

**412**

Chapter 19

***Editing Entries***

Now we'll make a page so users can edit the entries they've added.

**The edit_entry URL**

The URL for the page needs to pass the ID of the entry to be edited. Here's   
*learning_logs/urls.py*:

*urls.py*

*--snip--*

urlpatterns = \[  

*--snip--*

# Page for editing an entry.  
path('edit_entry/\<int:entry_id\>/', views.edit_entry, name='edit_entry'),

\]

This URL pattern matches URLs like *http://localhost:8000/edit_entry/id/*.

Here the value of

*id*

is assigned to the parameter

entry_id

. Django sends

requests that match this format to the view function

edit_entry()

.

**The edit_entry() View Function**

When the

edit_entry

page receives a GET request, the

edit_entry()

func-

tion returns a form for editing the entry. When the page receives a POST   
request with revised entry text, it saves the modified text into the database:

*views.py*

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

from .models import Topic, Entry

from .forms import TopicForm, EntryForm

*--snip--*

def edit_entry(request, entry_id):  
"""Edit an existing entry."""

1

entry = Entry.objects.get(id=entry_id)

topic = entry.topic

if request.method != 'POST':  
# Initial request; pre-fill form with the current entry.

2

form = EntryForm(instance=entry)

else:  
# POST data submitted; process data.

3

form = EntryForm(instance=entry, data=request.POST)

if form.is_valid():

4

form.save()

5

return redirect('learning_logs:topic', topic_id=topic.id)

context = {'entry': entry, 'topic': topic, 'form': form}  
return render(request, 'learning_logs/edit_entry.html', context)

We first import the

Entry

model. We then get the entry object that the

user wants to edit

1

and the topic associated with this entry. In the

if

![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress451.png)

User Accounts

**413**

block, which runs for a GET request, we make an instance of

EntryForm

with

the argument

instance=entry

2

. This argument tells Django to create the

form, prefilled with information from the existing entry object. The user   
will see their existing data and be able to edit that data.

When processing a POST request, we pass both the

instance=entry

and

the

data=request.POST

arguments

3

. These arguments tell Django to create a

form instance based on the information associated with the existing entry   
object, updated with any relevant data from

request.POST

. We then check

whether the form is valid; if it is, we call

save()

with no arguments because the

entry is already associated with the correct topic

4

. We then redirect to the

topic

page, where the user should see the updated version of the entry they

edited

5

.

If we're showing an initial form for editing the entry or if the submitted

form is invalid, we create the

context

dictionary and render the page using

the *edit_entry.html* template.

**The edit_entry Template**

Next, we create an *edit_entry.html* template, which is similar to *new_entry.html*:

*edit_entry.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

{% block content %}

\<p\>\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topic' topic.id %}"\>{{ topic }}\</a\>\</p\>

\<p\>Edit entry:\</p\>

1

\<form action="{% url 'learning_logs:edit_entry' entry.id %}" method='post'\>

{% csrf_token %}  
{{ form.as_div }}

2

\<button name="submit"\>Save changes\</button\>

\</form\>

{% endblock content %}

The

action

argument sends the form back to the

edit_entry()

function

for processing

1

. We include the

entry.id

as an argument in the

{% url %}

tag, so the view function can modify the correct entry object. We label the   
submit button as

Save changes

to remind the user they're saving edits, not

creating a new entry

2

.

**Linking to the edit_entry Page**

Now we need to include a link to the

edit_entry

page for each entry on the

topic page:

*topic.html*

*--snip--*

{% for entry in entries %}  
\<li\>  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress452.png)

**414**

Chapter 19

\<p\>{{ entry.date_added\|date:'M d, Y H:i' }}\</p\>  
\<p\>{{ entry.text\|linebreaks }}\</p\>  

\<p\>

\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:edit_entry' entry.id %}"\>  
Edit entry\</a\>\</p\>

\</li\>

*--snip--*

We include the edit link after each entry's date and text has been dis-

played. We use the

{% url %}

template tag to determine the URL for the

named URL pattern

edit_entry

, along with the ID attribute of the current

entry in the loop (

entry.id

). The link text

Edit entry

appears after each entry

on the page. Figure 19-3 shows what the topic page looks like with these   
links.

*Figure 19-3: Each entry now has a link for editing that entry.*

Learning Log now has most of the functionality it needs. Users can add

topics and entries, and they can read through any set of entries they want.   
In the next section, we'll implement a user registration system so anyone   
can make an account with Learning Log and create their own set of topics   
and entries.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress453.png)

User Accounts

**415**

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**19-1. Blog:**

Start a new Django project called

*Blog*

. Create an app called

*blogs*

, with one model that represents an overall blog, and one model that rep-

resents an individual blog post. Give each model an appropriate set of fields.   
Create a superuser for the project, and use the admin site to make a blog and   
a couple of short posts. Make a home page that shows all posts in an appropri-  
ate order.

Create pages for making a blog, for making new posts, and for editing

existing posts. Use your pages to make sure they work.

**Setting Up User Accounts**

In this section, we'll set up a user registration and authorization system so   
people can register an account, log in, and log out. We'll create a new app   
to contain all the functionality related to working with users. We'll use the   
default user authentication system included with Django to do as much   
of the work as possible. We'll also modify the

Topic

model slightly so every

topic belongs to a certain user.

***The accounts App***

We'll start by creating a new app called

accounts

, using the

startapp

command:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py startapp accounts**

(ll_env)learning_log$

**ls**

1

accounts db.sqlite3 learning_logs ll_env ll_project manage.py

(ll_env)learning_log$

**ls accounts**

2

__init__.py admin.py apps.py migrations models.py tests.py views.py

The default authentication system is built around the concept of user

accounts, so using the name

accounts

makes integration with the default sys-

tem easier. The

startapp

command shown here makes a new directory called

*accounts*

1

with a structure identical to the

learning_logs

app

2

.

**Adding accounts to settings.py**

We need to add our new app to

INSTALLED_APPS

in *settings.py*, like so:

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

INSTALLED_APPS = \[  
# My apps  
'learning_logs',

'accounts',  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress454.png)

**416**

Chapter 19

# Default django apps.  

*--snip--*

\]

*--snip--*

Now Django will include the

accounts

app in the overall project.

**Including the URLs from accounts**

Next, we need to modify the root *urls.py* so it includes the URLs we'll write   
for the

accounts

app:

*ll_project/urls.py*

from django.contrib import admin  
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = \[  
path('admin/', admin.site.urls),

path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),

path('', include('learning_logs.urls')),  
\]

We add a line to include the file *urls.py* from

accounts

. This line will

match any URL that starts with the word *accounts* , such as *http://localhost:
8000/accounts/login/*.

***The Login Page***

We'll first implement a login page. We'll use the default

login

view Django

provides, so the URL pattern for this app looks a little different. Make a   
new *urls.py* file in the directory *ll_project/accounts/* and add the following   
to it:

*accounts/urls.py*

"""Defines URL patterns for accounts."""

from django.urls import path, include

app_name = 'accounts'  
urlpatterns = \[  
# Include default auth urls.  
path('', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),  
\]

We import the

path

function, and then import the

include

function so

we can include some default authentication URLs that Django has defined.   
These default URLs include named URL patterns, such as

'login'

and

'logout'

. We set the variable

app_name

to

'accounts'

so Django can distin-

guish these URLs from URLs belonging to other apps. Even default URLs   
provided by Django, when included in the

accounts

app's *urls.py* file, will be

accessible through the

accounts

namespace.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress455.png)

User Accounts

**417**

The login page's pattern matches the URL *http://localhost:8000/accounts/*

*login/* . When Django reads this URL, the word *accounts* tells Django to   
look in *accounts/urls.py* , and *login* tells it to send requests to Django's   
default

login

view.

**The login Template**

When the user requests the login page, Django will use a default view   
function, but we still need to provide a template for the page. The default   
authentication views look for templates inside a folder called *registration* , so   
we'll need to make that folder. Inside the *ll_project/accounts/* directory, make   
a directory called *templates* ; inside that, make another directory called *registra-
tion* . Here's the *login.html* template, which should be saved in *ll_project/accounts/
templates/registration*:

*login.html*

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

{% block content %}

1

{% if form.errors %}

\<p\>Your username and password didn't match. Please try again.\</p\>  
{% endif %}

2

\<form action="{% url 'accounts:login' %}" method='post'\>

{% csrf_token %}

3

{{ form.as_div }}

4

\<button name="submit"\>Log in\</button\>

\</form\>

{% endblock content %}

This template extends *base.html* to ensure that the login page will have

the same look and feel as the rest of the site. Note that a template in one   
app can inherit from a template in another app.

If the form's

errors

attribute is set, we display an error message

1

, report-

ing that the username and password combination doesn't match anything   
stored in the database.

We want the login view to process the form, so we set the

action

argu-

ment as the URL of the login page

2

. The login view sends a

form

object

to the template, and it's up to us to display the form

3

and add a submit

button

4

.

**The LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL Settting**

Once a user logs in successfully, Django needs to know where to send that   
user. We control this in the settings file.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress456.png)

**418**

Chapter 19

Add the following code to the end of *settings.py*:

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

# My settings.  
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'learning_logs:index'

With all the default settings in *settings.py*, it's helpful to mark off the

section where we're adding new settings. The first new setting we'll add is

LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL

, which tells Django which URL to redirect to after a suc-

cessful login attempt.

**Linking to the Login Page**

Let's add the login link to *base.html* so it appears on every page. We don't   
want the link to display when the user is already logged in, so we nest it   
inside an

{% if %}

tag:

*base.html*

\<p\>  
\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}"\>Learning Log\</a\> -  

\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topics' %}"\>Topics\</a\> -

1

{% if user.is_authenticated %}

2

Hello, {{ user.username }}.

{% else %}

3

\<a href="{% url 'accounts:login' %}"\>Log in\</a\>

{% endif %}

\</p\>

{% block content %}{% endblock content %}

In Django's authentication system, every template has a

user

object

available that always has an

is_authenticated

attribute set: the attribute is

True

if the user is logged in and

False

if they aren't. This attribute allows you

to display one message to authenticated users and another to unauthenti-  
cated users.

Here we display a greeting to users currently logged in

1

. Authenticated

users have an additional

username

attribute set, which we use to personalize

the greeting and remind the user they're logged in

2

. For users who haven't

been authenticated, we display a link to the login page

3

.

**Using the Login Page**

We've already set up a user account, so let's log in to see if the page works.   
Go to *http://localhost:8000/admin/* . If you're still logged in as an admin, look   
for a **logout** link in the header and click it.

When you're logged out, go to *http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/*. You

should see a login page similar to the one shown in Figure 19-4. Enter the   
username and password you set up earlier, and you should be brought back   
to the home page. The header on the home page should display a greeting   
personalized with your username.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress457.png)

User Accounts

**419**

*Figure 19-4: The login page*

***Logging Out***

Now we need to provide a way for users to log out. Logout requests should   
be submitted as POST requests, so we'll add a small logout form to *base.html* .   
When users click the logout button, they'll go to a page confirming that   
they've been logged out.

**Adding a Logout Form to base.html**

We'll add the form for logging out to *base.html* so it's available on every   
page. We'll include it in another

if

block, so only users who are already

logged in can see it:

*base.html*

*--snip--*

{% block content %}{% endblock content %}

{% if user.is_authenticated %}

1

\<hr /\>

2

\<form action="{% url 'accounts:logout' %}" method='post'\>

{% csrf_token %}  
\<button name='submit'\>Log out\</button\>  
\</form\>  
{% endif %}

The default URL pattern for logging out is

'accounts/logout/'

. However,

the request has to be sent as a POST request; otherwise, attackers can eas-  
ily force logout requests. To make the logout request use POST, we define a   
simple form.

We place the form at the bottom of the page, below a horizontal rule

element (

\<hr /\>

)

1

. This is an easy way to always keep the logout button in a  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress458.png)

**420**

Chapter 19

consistent position below any other content on the page. The form itself has   
the logout URL as its

action

argument, and

'post'

as the request method

2

.

Every form in Django needs to include the

{% csrf_token %}

, even a simple

form like this one. This form is empty except for the submit button.

**The LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL Setting**

When the user clicks the logout button, Django needs to know where to   
send them. We control this behavior in *settings.py*:

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

# My settings.  
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'learning_logs:index'

LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'learning_logs:index'

The

LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL

setting shown here tells Django to redirect

logged-out users back to the home page. This is a simple way to confirm   
that they were logged out, because they should no longer see their user-  
name after logging out.

***The Registration Page***

Next, we'll build a page so new users can register. We'll use Django's default

UserCreationForm

, but write our own view function and template.

**The register URL**

The following code provides the URL pattern for the registration page,   
which should be placed in *accounts/urls.py*:

*accounts/urls.py*

"""Defines URL patterns for accounts."""

from django.urls import path, include

from . import views

app_name = accounts  
urlpatterns = \[  
# Include default auth urls.  
path('', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),

# Registration page.  
path('register/', views.register, name='register'),

\]

We import the

views

module from

accounts

, which we need because

we're writing our own view for the registration page. The pattern for the   
registration page matches the URL *http://localhost:8000/accounts/register/* and   
sends requests to the

register()

function we're about to write.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress459.png)

User Accounts

**421**

**The register() View Function**

The

register()

view function needs to display a blank registration form

when the registration page is first requested, and then process completed   
registration forms when they're submitted. When a registration is success-  
ful, the function also needs to log the new user in. Add the following code   
to*accounts/views.py*:

*accounts/*

*views.py*

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect  
from django.contrib.auth import login  
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

def register(request):  
"""Register a new user."""  
if request.method != 'POST':  
# Display blank registration form.

1

form = UserCreationForm()

else:  
# Process completed form.

2

form = UserCreationForm(data=request.POST)

3

if form.is_valid():

4

new_user = form.save()

# Log the user in and then redirect to home page.

5

login(request, new_user)

6

return redirect('learning_logs:index')

# Display a blank or invalid form.  
context = {'form': form}  
return render(request, 'registration/register.html', context)

We import the

render()

and

redirect()

functions, and then we import

the

login()

function to log the user in if their registration information is

correct. We also import the default

UserCreationForm

. In the

register()

func-

tion, we check whether we're responding to a POST request. If we're not, we   
make an instance of

UserCreationForm

with no initial data

1

.

If we're responding to a POST request, we make an instance of

UserCreationForm

based on the submitted data

2

. We check that the data

is valid

3

---in this case, that the username has the appropriate characters,

the passwords match, and the user isn't trying to do anything malicious in   
their submission.

If the submitted data is valid, we call the form's

save()

method to save

the username and the hash of the password to the database

4

. The

save()

method returns the newly created user object, which we assign to

new_user

.

When the user's information is saved, we log them in by calling the

login()

function with the

request

and

new_user

objects

5

, which creates a valid ses-

sion for the new user. Finally, we redirect the user to the home page

6

,  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress460.png)

**422**

Chapter 19

where a personalized greeting in the header tells them their registration   
was successful.

At the end of the function, we render the page, which will be either a

blank form or a submitted form that's invalid.

**The register Template**

Now create a template for the registration page, which will be similar to the   
login page. Be sure to save it in the same directory as *login.html*:

*register.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

{% block content %}

\<form action="{% url 'accounts:register' %}" method='post'\>  
{% csrf_token %}  
{{ form.as_div }}

\<button name="submit"\>Register\</button\>  
\</form\>

{% endblock content %}

This should look like the other form-based templates we've been writ-

ing. We use the

as_div

method again so Django will display all the fields in

the form appropriately, including any error messages if the form isn't filled   
out correctly.

**Linking to the Registration Page**

Next, we'll add code to show the registration page link to any user who isn't   
currently logged in:

*base.html*

*--snip--*

{% if user.is_authenticated %}  
Hello, {{ user.username }}.  
{% else %}  

\<a href="{% url 'accounts:register' %}"\>Register\</a\> -

\<a href="{% url 'accounts:login' %}"\>Log in\</a\>  
{% endif %}

*--snip--*

Now users who are logged in see a personalized greeting and a logout

button. Users who aren't logged in see a registration link and a login link.   
Try out the registration page by making several user accounts with different   
usernames.

In the next section, we'll restrict some of the pages so they're available

only to registered users, and we'll make sure every topic belongs to a spe-  
cific user.

User Accounts

**423**

**N O T E**

*The registration system we've set up allows anyone to make any number of accounts*

*for Learning Log. Some systems require users to confirm their identity by sending a
confirmation email that users must reply to. By doing so, the system generates fewer
spam accounts than the simple system we're using here. However, when you're learn-
ing to build apps, it's perfectly appropriate to practice with a simple user registration
system like the one we're using.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**19-2. Blog Accounts:**

Add a user authentication and registration system to the

Blog project you started in Exercise 19-1 ([page 415](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#453)). Make sure logged-in users   
see their username somewhere on the screen and unregistered users see a link   
to the registration page.

**Allowing Users to Own Their Data**

Users should be able to enter private data in their learning logs, so we'll   
create a system to figure out which data belongs to which user. Then we'll   
restrict access to certain pages so users can only work with their own data.

We'll modify the

Topic

model so every topic belongs to a specific user.

This will also take care of entries, because every entry belongs to a specific   
topic. We'll start by restricting access to certain pages.

***Restricting Access with @login_required***

Django makes it easy to restrict access to certain pages through the

@login

_required

decorator. Recall from [Chapter 11](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#247) that a *decorator* is a directive

placed just before a function definition, which modifies how the function   
behaves. Let's look at an example.

**Restricting Access to the Topics Page**

Each topic will be owned by a user, so only registered users can request the   
topics page. Add the following code to *learning_logs/views.py*:

*learning_logs/*

*views.py*

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

from .models import Topic, Entry

*--snip--*

@login_required

def topics(request):  
"""Show all topics."""  

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress462.png)

**424**

Chapter 19

We first import the

login_required()

function. We apply

login_required()

as a decorator to the

topics()

view function by prepending

login_required

with the

@

symbol. As a result, Python knows to run the code in

login

_required()

before the code in

topics()

.

The code in

login_required()

checks whether a user is logged in, and

Django runs the code in

topics()

only if they are. If the user isn't logged in,

they're redirected to the login page.

To make this redirect work, we need to modify *settings.py* so Django knows

where to find the login page. Add the following at the end of *settings.py*:

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

# My settings.  
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'learning_logs:index'  
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'learning_logs:index'

LOGIN_URL = 'accounts:login'

Now when an unauthenticated user requests a page protected by the

@login_required

decorator, Django will send the user to the URL defined by

LOGIN_URL

in *settings.py*.

You can test this setting by logging out of any user accounts and going

to the home page. Click the **Topics** link, which should redirect you to the   
login page. Then log in to any of your accounts, and from the home page,   
click the **Topics** link again. You should be able to access the topics page.

**Restricting Access Throughout Learning Log**

Django makes it easy to restrict access to pages, but you have to decide which   
pages to protect. It's best to think about which pages need to be unrestricted   
first, and then restrict all the other pages in the project. You can easily cor-  
rect over-restricted access, and it's less dangerous than leaving sensitive   
pages unrestricted.

In Learning Log, we'll keep the home page and the registration page

unrestricted. We'll restrict access to every other page.

Here's *learning_logs/views.py* with

@login_required

decorators applied to

every view except

index()

:

*learning_logs/*

*views.py*

*--snip--*

@login_required  
def topics(request):  

*--snip--*

@login_required

def topic(request, topic_id):  

*--snip--*

@login_required

def new_topic(request):  

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress463.png)

User Accounts

**425**

@login_required

def new_entry(request, topic_id):  

*--snip--*

@login_required

def edit_entry(request, entry_id):  

*--snip--*

Try accessing each of these pages while logged out; you should be redi-

rected back to the login page. You'll also be unable to click links to pages   
such as

new_topic

. But if you enter the URL *http://localhost:8000/new_topic/*,

you'll be redirected to the login page. You should restrict access to any URL   
that's publicly accessible and relates to private user data.

***Connecting Data to Certain Users***

Next, we need to connect the data to the user who submitted it. We only need   
to connect the data highest in the hierarchy to a user, and the lower-level data   
will follow. In Learning Log, topics are the highest level of data in the app,   
and all entries are connected to a topic. As long as each topic belongs to a   
specific user, we can trace the ownership of each entry in the database.

We'll modify the

Topic

model by adding a foreign key relationship to a

user. We'll then have to migrate the database. Finally, we'll modify some of the   
views so they only show the data associated with the currently logged-in user.

**Modifying the Topic Model**

The modification to *models.py* is just two lines:

*models.py*

from django.db import models

from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Topic(models.Model):  
"""A topic the user is learning about."""  
Text = models.CharField(max_length=200)  
date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

def __str__(self):  
"""Return a string representing the topic."""  
Return self.text

class Entry(models.Model):  

*--snip--*

We import the

User

model from

django.contrib.auth

. Then we add an

owner

field to

Topic

, which establishes a foreign key relationship to the

User

model. If a user is deleted, all the topics associated with that user will be   
deleted as well.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress464.png)

**426**

Chapter 19

**Identifying Existing Users**

When we migrate the database, Django will modify the database so it can   
store a connection between each topic and a user. To make the migration,   
Django needs to know which user to associate with each existing topic. The   
simplest approach is to start by assigning all existing topics to one user---for   
example, the superuser. But first, we need to know that user's ID.

Let's look at the IDs of all users created so far. Start a Django shell ses-

sion and issue the following commands:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py shell**

1

\>\>\>

**from django.contrib.auth.models import User**

2

\>\>\>

**User.objects.all()**

\<QuerySet \[\<User: ll_admin\>, \<User: eric\>, \<User: willie\>\]\>

3

\>\>\>

**for user in User.objects.all():**

...

**print(user.username, user.id)**

...  
ll_admin 1  
eric 2  
willie 3  
\>\>\>

We first import the

User

model into the shell session

1

. We then look at

all the users that have been created so far

2

. The output shows three users

for my version of the project:

ll_admin

,

eric

, and

willie

.

Next, we loop through the list of users and print each user's username

and ID

3

. When Django asks which user to associate the existing topics

with, we'll use one of these ID values.

**Migrating the Database**

Now that we know the IDs, we can migrate the database. When we do this,   
Python will ask us to connect the

Topic

model to a particular owner tempo-

rarily or to add a default to our *models.py* file to tell it what to do. Choose   
option **1**:

1

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs**

2

It is impossible to add a non-nullable field 'owner' to topic without

specifying a default. This is because...

3

Please select a fix:

1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a  
null value for this column)  
2) Quit and manually define a default value in models.py.

4

Select an option:

**1**

5

Please enter the default value now, as valid Python

The datetime and django.utils.timezone modules are available...  
Type 'exit' to exit this prompt

Migrations for 'learning_logs':  
learning_logs/migrations/0003_topic_owner.py

(ll_env)learning_log$  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress465.png)

User Accounts

**427**

We start by issuing the

makemigrations

command

1

. In the output,

Django indicates that we're trying to add a required (*non-nullable* ) field to   
an existing model (

topic

) with no default value specified

2

. Django gives

us two options: we can provide a default right now, or we can quit and add   
a default value in *models.py*

3

. Here I've chosen the first option

4

. Django

then asks us to enter the default value

5

.

To associate all existing topics with the original admin user,

ll_admin

, I

entered the user ID of

1

6

. You can use the ID of any user you've created;

it doesn't have to be a superuser. Django then migrates the database using   
this value and generates the migration file *0003_topic_owner.py* , which adds   
the field

owner

to the

Topic

model.

Now we can execute the migration. Enter the following in an active vir-

tual environment:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**python manage.py migrate**

Operations to perform:  
Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, learning_logs, sessions  
Running migrations:

1

Applying learning_logs.0003_topic_owner... OK

(ll_env)learning_log$

Django applies the new migration, and the result is

OK

1

.

We can verify that the migration worked as expected in a shell session,

like this:

\>\>\>

**from learning_logs.models import Topic**

\>\>\>

**for topic in Topic.objects.all():**

...

**print(topic, topic.owner)**

...  
Chess ll_admin  
Rock Climbing ll_admin  
\>\>\>

We import

Topic

from

learning_logs.models

and then loop through all

existing topics, printing each topic and the user it belongs to. You can see   
that each topic now belongs to the user

ll_admin

. (If you get an error when

you run this code, try exiting the shell and starting a new shell.)

**N O T E**

*You can simply reset the database instead of migrating, but that will lose all existing*

*data. It's good practice to learn how to migrate a database while maintaining the
integrity of users' data. If you do want to start with a fresh database, issue the com-
mand*

***python manage.py flush***

*to rebuild the database structure. You'll have to create*

*a new superuser, and all of your data will be gone.*

***Restricting Topics Access to Appropriate Users***

Currently, if you're logged in, you'll be able to see all the topics, no matter   
which user you're logged in as. We'll change that by showing users only the   
topics that belong to them.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress466.png)

**428**

Chapter 19

Make the following change to the

topics()

function in *views.py*:

*learning_logs/*

*views.py*

*--snip--*

@login_required  
def topics(request):  
"""Show all topics."""

topics = Topic.objects.filter(owner=request.user).order_by('date_added')

context = {'topics': topics}  
return render(request, 'learning_logs/topics.html', context)

*--snip--*

When a user is logged in, the

request

object has a

request.user

attribute

set, which contains information about the user. The query

Topic.objects

.filter(owner=request.user)

tells Django to retrieve only the

Topic

objects

from the database whose

owner

attribute matches the current user. Because

we're not changing how the topics are displayed, we don't need to change   
the template for the topics page at all.

To see if this works, log in as the user you connected all existing topics

to, and go to the topics page. You should see all the topics. Now log out and   
log back in as a different user. You should see the message "No topics have   
been added yet."

***Protecting a User's Topics***

We haven't restricted access to the topic pages yet, so any registered user   
could try a bunch of URLs (like *http://localhost:8000/topics/1/* ) and retrieve   
topic pages that happen to match.

Try it yourself. While logged in as the user that owns all topics, copy the

URL or note the ID in the URL of a topic, and then log out and log back in   
as a different user. Enter that topic's URL. You should be able to read the   
entries, even though you're logged in as a different user.

We'll fix this now by performing a check before retrieving the requested

entries in the

topic()

view function:

*learning_logs/*

*views.py*

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect  
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

1

from django.http import Http404

*--snip--*

@login_required  
def topic(request, topic_id):  
"""Show a single topic and all its entries."""  
topic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id)

# Make sure the topic belongs to the current user.

2

if topic.owner != request.user:

raise Http404

entries = topic.entry_set.order_by('-date_added')  
context = {'topic': topic, 'entries': entries}  
return render(request, 'learning_logs/topic.html', context)

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress467.png)

User Accounts

**429**

A 404 response is a standard error response that's returned when a

requested resource doesn't exist on a server. Here we import the

Http404

exception

1

, which we'll raise if the user requests a topic they shouldn't

have access to. After receiving a topic request, we make sure the topic's   
user matches the currently logged-in user before rendering the page. If the   
requested topic's owner is not the same as the current user, we raise the

Http404

exception

2

, and Django returns a 404-error page.

Now if you try to view another user's topic entries, you'll see a "Page Not

Found" message from Django. I[n Chapter 20](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#471), we'll configure the project so   
users will see a proper error page instead of a debugging page.

***Protecting the edit_entry Page***

The

edit_entry

pages have URLs of the form *http://localhost:8000/edit_entry/*

*entry_id/*, where the

*entry_id*

is a number. Let's protect this page so no one

can use the URL to gain access to someone else's entries:

*learning_logs/*

*views.py*

*--snip--*

@login_required  
def edit_entry(request, entry_id):  
"""Edit an existing entry."""  
entry = Entry.objects.get(id=entry_id)  
topic = entry.topic

if topic.owner != request.user:  
raise Http404

if request.method != 'POST':

*--snip--*

We retrieve the entry and the topic associated with this entry. We then

check whether the owner of the topic matches the currently logged-in user;   
if they don't match, we raise an

Http404

exception.

***Associating New Topics with the Current User***

Currently, the page for adding new topics is broken because it doesn't   
associate new topics with any particular user. If you try adding a new topic,   
you'll see the message

IntegrityError

along with

NOT NULL constraint failed:

learning_logs_topic.owner_id

. Django is saying you can't create a new topic

without specifying a value for the topic's

owner

field.

There's a straightforward fix for this problem, because we have access

to the current user through the

request

object. Add the following code,

which associates the new topic with the current user:

*learning_logs/*

*views.py*

*--snip--*

@login_required  
def new_topic(request):  

*--snip--*

else:  
# POST data submitted; process data.  
form = TopicForm(data=request.POST)  
if form.is_valid():  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress468.png)

**430**

Chapter 19

1

new_topic = form.save(commit=False)

2

new_topic.owner = request.user

3

new_topic.save()

return redirect('learning_logs:topics')

# Display a blank or invalid form.  
context = {'form': form}  
return render(request, 'learning_logs/new_topic.html', context)  

*--snip--*

When we first call

form.save()

, we pass the

commit=False

argument because

we need to modify the new topic before saving it to the database

1

. We then

set the new topic's

owner

attribute to the current user

2

. Finally, we call

save()

on the topic instance we just defined

3

. Now the topic has all the required

data and will save successfully.

You should be able to add as many new topics as you want for as many

different users as you want. Each user will only have access to their own data,   
whether they're viewing data, entering new data, or modifying old data.

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**19-3. Refactoring:**

There are two places in

*views.py*

where we make sure the

user associated with a topic matches the currently logged-in user. Put the code   
for this check in a function called

check_topic_owner()

, and call this function

where appropriate.

**19-4. Protecting new_entry:**

Currently, a user can add a new entry to another

user's learning log by entering a URL with the ID of a topic belonging to   
another user. Prevent this attack by checking that the current user owns the   
entry's topic before saving the new entry.

**19-5. Protected Blog:**

In your Blog project, make sure each blog post is con-

nected to a particular user. Make sure all posts are publicly accessible but only   
registered users can add posts and edit existing posts. In the view that allows   
users to edit their posts, make sure the user is editing their own post before pro-  
cessing the form.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned how forms allow users to add new topics and   
entries, and edit existing entries. You then learned how to implement user   
accounts. You gave existing users the ability to log in and out, and used   
Django's default

UserCreationForm

to let people create new accounts.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress469.png)

User Accounts

**431**

After building a simple user authentication and registration system, you

restricted access to logged-in users for certain pages using the

@login_required

decorator. You then assigned data to specific users through a foreign key   
relationship. You also learned to migrate the database when the migration   
requires you to specify some default data.

Finally, you learned how to make sure a user can only see data that

belongs to them by modifying the view functions. You retrieved appro-  
priate data using the

filter()

method, and compared the owner of the

requested data to the currently logged-in user.

It might not always be immediately obvious what data you should make

available and what data you should protect, but this skill will come with   
practice. The decisions we've made in this chapter to secure our users' data   
also illustrate why working with others is a good idea when building a proj-  
ect: having someone else look over your project makes it more likely that   
you'll spot vulnerable areas.

You now have a fully functioning project running on your local machine.

In the final chapter, you'll style Learning Log to make it visually appealing,   
and you'll deploy the project to a server so anyone with internet access can   
register and make an account.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress470.png)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress471.png)

**20**

**S T Y L I N G A N D D E P L O Y I N G**

**A N A P P**

Learning Log is fully functional now, but

it has no styling and runs only on your

local machine. In this chapter, you'll style

the project in a simple but professional man-

ner and then deploy it to a live server so anyone in the   
world can make an account and use it.

For the styling, we'll use the *Bootstrap* library, a collection of tools for

styling web applications so they look professional on all modern devices,   
from a small phone to a large desktop monitor. To do this, we'll use the   
django-bootstrap5 app, which will also give you practice using apps made   
by other Django developers.

We'll deploy Learning Log using *Platform.sh*, a site that lets you push

your project to one of its servers, making it available to anyone with an   
internet connection. We'll also start using a version control system called   
Git to track changes to the project.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress472.png)

**434**

Chapter 20

When you're finished with Learning Log, you'll be able to develop

simple web applications, give them a professional look and feel, and deploy   
them to a live server. You'll also be able to use more advanced learning   
resources as you develop your skills.

**Styling Learning Log**

We've purposely ignored styling until now to focus on Learning Log's func-  
tionality first. This is a good way to approach development, because an app   
is only useful if it works. Once an app is working, its appearance is critical   
so people will want to use it.

In this section, we'll install the django-bootstrap5 app and add it to the

project. We'll then use it to style the individual pages in the project, so all   
the pages have a consistent look and feel.

***The django-bootstrap5 App***

We'll use django-bootstrap5 to integrate Bootstrap into our project. This   
app downloads the required Bootstrap files, places them in an appropriate   
location in your project, and makes the styling directives available in your   
project's templates.

To install django-bootstrap5, issue the following command in an active

virtual environment:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**pip install django-bootstrap5**

*--snip--*

Successfully installed beautifulsoup4-4.11.1 django-bootstrap5-21.3  
soupsieve-2.3.2.post1

Next, we need to add django-bootstrap5 to

INSTALLED_APPS

in *settings.py*:

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

INSTALLED_APPS = \[  
# My apps.  
'learning_logs',  
'accounts',

# Third party apps.  
'django_bootstrap5',

# Default django apps.  
'django.contrib.admin',  

*--snip--*

Start a new section called

Third party apps

, for apps created by other devel-

opers, and add

'django_bootstrap5'

to this section. Make sure you place this

section after

My apps

but before the section containing Django's default apps.

***Using Bootstrap to Style Learning Log***

Bootstrap is a large collection of styling tools. It also has a number of tem-  
plates you can apply to your project to create an overall style. It's much   
easier to use these templates than to use individual styling tools. To see the  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress473.png)

Styling and Deploying an App

**435**

templates Bootstrap offers, go to [*https://getbootstrap.com* a](https://getbootstrap.com)nd click **Examples** .   
We'll use the*Navbar static* template, which provides a simple top navigation   
bar and a container for the page's content.

Figure 20-1 shows what the home page will look like after we apply

Bootstrap's template to *base.html* and modify*index.html* slightly.

*Figure 20-1: The Learning Log home page using Bootstrap*

***Modifying base.html***

We need to rewrite *base.html* using the Bootstrap template. We'll develop   
the new*base.html* in sections. This is a large file; you may want to copy this   
file from the online resources, available a[t *https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e*](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e). If   
you do copy the file, you should still read through the following section to   
understand the changes that were made.

**Defining the HTML Headers**

The first change we'll make to *base.html* defines the HTML headers in the   
file. We'll also add some requirements for using Bootstrap in our templates,   
and give the page a title. Delete everything in *base.html* and replace it with   
the following code:

*base.html*

1

\<!doctype html\>

2

\<html lang="en"\>

3

\<head\>

\<meta charset="utf-8"\>  
\<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"\>

4

\<title\>Learning Log\</title\>

5

{% load django_bootstrap5 %}

{% bootstrap_css %}  
{% bootstrap_javascript %}

\</head\>

Chapter 20

We first declare this file as an HTML document

1

written in English

2

.

An HTML file is divided into two main parts: the *head* and the *body* . The   
head of the file begins with an opening

\<head\>

tag

3

. The head of an HTML

file doesn't hold any of the page's content; it just tells the browser what it   
needs to know to display the page correctly. We include a

\<title\>

element for

the page, which will display in the browser's title bar whenever Learning Log   
is open

4

.

Before closing the head section, we load the collection of template tags

available in django-bootstrap5

5

. The template tag

{% bootstrap_css %}

is a

custom tag from django-bootstrap5; it loads all of the CSS files required to   
implement Bootstrap styles. The tag that follows enables all the interactive   
behavior you might use on a page, such as collapsible navigation bars. The   
closing

\</head\>

tag appears on the last line.

All Bootstrap styling options are now available in any template that

inherits from *base.html* . If you want to use custom template tags from   
django-bootstrap5, each template will need to include the

{% load django

_bootstrap5 %}

tag.

**Defining the Navigation Bar**

The code that defines the navigation bar at the top of the page is fairly long,   
because it has to work equally well on narrow phone screens and wide desk-  
top monitors. We'll work through the navigation bar in sections.

Here's the first part of the navigation bar:

*base.html*

*--snip--*

\</head\>

\<body\>

1

\<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg-light mb-4 border"\>

\<div class="container-fluid"\>

2

\<a class="navbar-brand" href="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}"\>

Learning Log\</a\>

3

\<button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"

data-bs-target="#navbarCollapse" aria-controls="navbarCollapse"  
aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"\>  
\<span class="navbar-toggler-icon"\>\</span\>  
\</button\>

4

\<div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarCollapse"\>

5

\<ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-md-0"\>

6

\<li class="nav-item"\>

7

\<a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'learning_logs:topics' %}"\>

Topics\</a\>\</li\>  
\</ul\> \<!-- End of links on left side of navbar --\>  
\</div\> \<!-- Closes collapsible parts of navbar --\>

\</div\> \<!-- Closes navbar's container --\>  
\</nav\> \<!-- End of navbar --\>  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress475.png)

Styling and Deploying an App

**437**

{% block content %}{% endblock content %}

\</body\>  
\</html\>

The first new element is the opening

\<body\>

tag. The *body* of an HTML

file contains the content users will see on a page. Next we have a

\<nav\>

ele-

ment, which opens the code for the navigation bar at the top of the page

1

.

Everything contained in this element is styled according to the Bootstrap   
style rules defined by the selectors

navbar

,

navbar-expand-md

, and the rest that

you see here. A *selector* determines which elements on a page a certain style   
rule applies to. The

navbar-light

and

bg-light

selectors style the navigation bar

with a light-themed background. The

mb

in

mb-4

is short for *margin-bottom*; this

selector ensures that a little space appears between the navigation bar and   
the rest of the page. The

border

selector provides a thin border around the

light background to set it off a little from the rest of the page.

The

\<div\>

tag on the next line opens a resizable container that will hold

the overall navigation bar. The term *div* is short for *division* ; you build a web   
page by dividing it into sections and defining style and behavior rules that   
apply to that section. Any styling or behavior rules that are defined in an   
opening

\<div\>

tag affect everything you see until its corresponding closing

tag, written as

\</div\>

.

Next we set the project's name,

Learning Log

, to appear as the first ele-

ment on the navigation bar

2

. This will also serve as a link to the home

page, just as it's been doing in the minimally styled version of the project we   
built in the previous two chapters. The

navbar-brand

selector styles this link

so it stands out from the rest of the links and helps add some branding to   
the site.

The Bootstrap template then defines a button that appears if the browser

window is too narrow to display the whole navigation bar horizontally

3

.

When the user clicks the button, the navigation elements appear in a drop-  
down list. The

collapse

reference causes the navigation bar to collapse when

the user shrinks the browser window or when the site is displayed on devices   
with small screens.

Next, we open a new section (

\<div\>

) of the navigation bar

4

. This is the

part of the navigation bar that can collapse depending on the size of the   
browser window.

Bootstrap defines navigation elements as items in an unordered list

5

,

with style rules that make it look nothing like a list. Every link or element   
you need on the bar can be included as an item in an unordered list

6

.

Here, the only item in the list is our link to the topics page

7

. Notice the

closing

\</li\>

tag at the end of the link; every opening tag needs a corre-

sponding closing tag.

The rest of the lines shown here close out all of the tags that have been

opened. In HTML, a comment is written like this:

\<!-- This is an HTML comment. --\>  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress476.png)

**438**

Chapter 20

Closing tags don't usually have comments, but if you're new to HTML,

it can be really helpful to label some of your closing tags. A single missing   
tag or an extra tag can throw off the layout of an entire page. We include   
the

content

block

8

and the closing

\</body\>

and

\</html\>

tags as well.

We're not finished with the navigation bar, but we now have a complete

HTML document. If

runserver

is currently active, stop the current server

and restart it. Go to the project's home page, and you should see a naviga-  
tion bar that has some of the elements shown in Figure 20-1. Now let's add   
the rest of the elements to the navigation bar.

**Adding User Account Links**

We still need to add the links associated with user accounts. We'll start by   
adding all of the account-related links except the logout form.

Make the following changes to *base.html*:

*base.html*

*--snip--*

\</ul\> \<!-- End of links on left side of navbar --\>

\<!-- Account-related links --\>

1

\<ul class="navbar-nav ms-auto mb-2 mb-md-0"\>

2

{% if user.is_authenticated %}

\<li class="nav-item"\>

3

\<span class="navbar-text me-2"\>Hello, {{ user.username }}.

\</span\>\</li\>

4

{% else %}

\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'accounts:register' %}"\>  
Register\</a\>\</li\>  
\<li class="nav-item"\>  
\<a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'accounts:login' %}"\>  
Log in\</a\>\</li\>  
{% endif %}

\</ul\> \<!-- End of account-related links --\>

\</div\> \<!-- Closes collapsible parts of navbar --\>  

*--snip--*

We begin a new set of links by using another opening

\<ul\>

tag

1

. You

can have as many groups of links as you need on a page. The selector

ms-auto

is short for *margin-start-automatic*: this selector examines the other

elements in the navigation bar and works out a left (start) margin that   
pushes this group of links to the right side of the browser window.

The

if

block is the same conditional block we used earlier to display

appropriate messages to users, depending on whether they're logged in

2

.

The block is a little longer now because there are some styling rules inside   
the conditional tags. The greeting for authenticated users is wrapped in a

\<span\>

element

3

. A *span element* styles pieces of text or elements of a page

that are part of a longer line. While div elements create their own divisions   
in a page, span elements are continuous within a larger section. This can  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress477.png)

Styling and Deploying an App

**439**

be confusing at first, because many pages have deeply nested div elements.   
Here, we're using the span element to style informational text on the navi-  
gation bar: in this case, the logged-in user's name.

In the

else

block, which runs for unauthenticated users, we include the

links for registering a new account and logging in

4

. These should look just

like the link to the topics page.

If you wanted to add more links to the navigation bar, you'd add another

\<li\>

item to one of the

\<ul\>

groups that we've defined, using styling directives

like the ones you've seen here.

Now let's add the logout form to the navigation bar.

**Adding the Logout Form to the Navigation Bar**

When we first wrote the logout form, we added it to the bottom of *base.html* .   
Now let's put it in a better place, in the navigation bar:

*base.html*

*--snip--*

\</ul\> \<!-- End of account-related links --\>

{% if user.is_authenticated %}  
\<form action="{% url 'accounts:logout' %}" method='post'\>  
{% csrf_token %}

1

\<button name='submit' class='btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm'\>

Log out\</button\>

\</form\>  
{% endif %}

\</div\> \<!-- Closes collapsible parts of navbar --\>  

*--snip--*

The logout form should be placed after the set of account-related links,

but inside the collapsible section of the navigation bar. The only change in the   
form is the addition of a number of Bootstrap styling classes in the

\<button\>

element, which apply Bootstrap styling elements to the logout button

1

.

Reload the home page, and you should be able to log in and out using

any of the accounts you've created.

There's still a bit more we need to add to *base.html*. We need to define

two blocks that the individual pages can use to place the content specific to   
those pages.

**Defining the Main Part of the Page**

The rest of *base.html* contains the main part of the page:

*base.html*

*--snip--*

\</nav\> \<!-- End of navbar --\>

1

\<main class="container"\>

2

\<div class="pb-2 mb-2 border-bottom"\>

{% block page_header %}{% endblock page_header %}  
\</div\>  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress478.png)

**440**

Chapter 20

3

\<div\>

{% block content %}{% endblock content %}

\</div\>  
\</main\>

\</body\>  
\</html\>

We first open a

\<main\>

tag

1

. The *main* element is used for the most

significant part of the body of a page. Here we assign the bootstrap selector

container

, which is a simple way to group elements on a page. We'll place

two div elements in this container.

The first div element contains a

page_header

block

2

. We'll use this block

to title most pages. To make this section stand out from the rest of the page,   
we place some padding below the header. *Padding* refers to space between   
an element's content and its border. The selector

pb-2

is a bootstrap directive

that provides a moderate amount of padding at the bottom of the styled ele-  
ment. A *margin* is the space between an element's border and other elements   
on the page. The selector

mb-2

provides a moderate amount of margin at the

bottom of this div. We want a border on the bottom of this block, so we use   
the selector

border-bottom

, which provides a thin border at the bottom of the

page_header

block.

We then define one more div element that contains the block

content

3

.

We don't apply any specific style to this block, so we can style the content of   
any page as we see fit for that page. The end of the *base.html* file has closing   
tags for the

main

,

body

, and

html

elements.

When you load Learning Log's home page in a browser, you should

see a professional-looking navigation bar that matches the one shown in   
Figure 20-1. Try resizing the window so it's really narrow; a button should   
replace the navigation bar. Click the button, and all the links should appear   
in a drop-down list.

***Styling the Home Page Using a Jumbotron***

To update the home page, we'll use a Bootstrap element called a *jumbotron* ,   
a large box that stands out from the rest of the page. Typically, it's used on   
home pages to hold a brief description of the overall project and a call to   
action that invites the viewer to get involved.

Here's the revised *index.html* file:

*index.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

1

{% block page_header %}

2

\<div class="p-3 mb-4 bg-light border rounded-3"\>

\<div class="container-fluid py-4"\>

3

\<h1 class="display-3"\>Track your learning.\</h1\>

4

\<p class="lead"\>Make your own Learning Log, and keep a list of the

topics you're learning about. Whenever you learn something new  
about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you've learned.\</p\>  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress479.png)

Styling and Deploying an App

**441**

5

\<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg mt-1"

href="{% url 'accounts:register' %}"\>Register \>\>\</a\>  
\</div\>  
\</div\>  
{% endblock page_header %}

We first tell Django that we're about to define what goes in the

page

_header

block

1

. A jumbotron is implemented as a pair of div elements with

a set of styling directives applied to them

2

. The outer div has padding and

margin settings, a light background color, and rounded corners. The inner   
div is a container that changes along with the window size and has some   
padding as well. The

py-4

selector adds padding to the top and bottom of

the div element. Feel free to adjust the numbers in these settings and see   
how the home page changes.

Inside the jumbotron are three elements. The first is a short message,

Track your learning

, that gives new visitors a sense of what Learning Log

does

3

. The

\<h1\>

element is a first-level header, and the

display-3

selector

adds a thinner and taller look to this particular header. We also include a   
longer message that provides more information about what the user can do   
with their learning log

4

. This is formatted as a

lead

paragraph, which is

meant to stand out from regular paragraphs.

Rather than just using a text link, we create a button that invites users

to register an account on Learning Log

5

. This is the same link as in the

header, but the button stands out on the page and shows the viewer what   
they need to do in order to start using the project. The selectors you see   
here style this as a large button that represents a call to action. The code

\>\>

is an *HTML entity* that looks like two right angle brackets combined

(\>\>). Finally, we provide closing div tags and close the

page_header

block.

With only two div elements in this file, it's not particularly helpful to label   
the closing div tags. We aren't adding anything else to this page, so we don't   
need to define the

content

block in this template.

The home page now looks like Figure 20-1. This is a significant improve-

ment over the unstyled version of the project!

***Styling the Login Page***

We've refined the overall appearance of the login page, but the login form   
itself doesn't have any styling yet. Let's make the form look consistent with   
the rest of the page by modifying *login.html*:

*login.html*

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

1

{% load django_bootstrap5 %}

2

{% block page_header %}

\<h2\>Log in to your account.\</h2\>  
{% endblock page_header %}

{% block content %}  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress480.png)

**442**

Chapter 20

\<form action="{% url 'accounts:login' %}" method='post'\>  
{% csrf_token %}

3

{% bootstrap_form form %}

4

{% bootstrap_button button_type="submit" content="Log in" %}

\</form\>

{% endblock content %}

We first load the

bootstrap5

template tags into this template

1

. We then

define the

page_header

block, which tells the user what the page is for

2

.

Notice that we've removed the

{% if form.errors %}

block from the template;

django-bootstrap5 manages form errors automatically.

To display the form, we use the template tag

{% bootstrap_form %}

3

; this

replaces the

{{ form.as_div }}

element we were using in [Chapter 19](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#441). The

{% booststrap_form %}

template tag inserts Bootstrap style rules into the form's

individual elements as the form is rendered. To generate the submit button,   
we use the

{% bootstrap_button %}

tag with arguments that designate it as a

submit button, and give it the label

Log in

4

.

Figure 20-2 shows the login form now. The page is much cleaner, with

consistent styling and a clear purpose. Try logging in with an incorrect   
username or password; you'll see that even the error messages are styled   
consistently and integrate well with the overall site.

*Figure 20-2: The login page styled with Bootstrap*

***Styling the Topics Page***

Let's make sure the pages for viewing information are styled appropriately   
as well, starting with the topics page:

*topics.html*

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

{% block page_header %}  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress481.png)

Styling and Deploying an App

**443**

1

\<h1\>Topics\</h1\>

{% endblock page_header %}

{% block content %}

2

\<ul class="list-group border-bottom pb-2 mb-4"\>

{% for topic in topics %}

3

\<li class="list-group-item border-0"\>

\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:topic' topic.id %}"\>  
{{ topic.text }}\</a\>  
\</li\>

{% empty %}

4

\<li class="list-group-item border-0"\>No topics have been added yet.\</li\>

{% endfor %}  
\</ul\>

\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:new_topic' %}"\>Add a new topic\</a\>

{% endblock content %}

We don't need the

{% load bootstrap5 %}

tag, because we're not using any

custom bootstrap5 template tags in this file. We move the heading

Topics

into the

page_header

block and make it an

\<h1\>

element instead of a simple

paragraph

1

.

The main content on this page is a list of topics, so we use Bootstrap's

*list group* component to render the page. This applies a simple set of styling   
directives to the overall list and to each item in the list. When we open the

\<ul\>

tag, we first include the

list-group

class to apply the default style direc-

tives to the list

2

. We further customize the list by putting a border at the

bottom of the list, a little padding below the list (

pb-2

), and a margin below

the bottom border (

mb-4

).

Each item in the list needs the

list-group-item

class, and we customize

the default style by removing the border around individual items

3

. The

message that's displayed when the list is empty needs these same classes

4

.

When you visit the topics page now, you should see a page with styling

that matches the home page.

***Styling the Entries on the Topic Page***

On the topic page, we'll use Bootstrap's card component to make each   
entry stand out. A *card* is a nestable set of divs with flexible, predefined   
styles that are perfect for displaying a topic's entries:

*topic.html*

{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}

1

{% block page_header %}

\<h1\>{{ topic.text }}\</h1\>  
{% endblock page_header %}  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress482.png)

**444**

Chapter 20

{% block content %}  
\<p\>  
\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:new_entry' topic.id %}"\>Add new entry\</a\>  
\</p\>

{% for entry in entries %}

2

\<div class="card mb-3"\>

\<!-- Card header with timestamp and edit link --\>

3

\<h4 class="card-header"\>

{{ entry.date_added\|date:'M d, Y H:i' }}

4

\<small\>\<a href="{% url 'learning_logs:edit_entry' entry.id %}"\>

edit entry\</a\>\</small\>  
\</h4\>  
\<!-- Card body with entry text --\>

5

\<div class="card-body"\>{{ entry.text\|linebreaks }}\</div\>

\</div\>

{% empty %}

6

\<p\>There are no entries for this topic yet.\</p\>

{% endfor %}

{% endblock content %}

We first place the topic in the

page_header

block

1

. Then we delete the

unordered list structure previously used in this template. Instead of making   
each entry a list item, we open a div element with the selector

card

2

. This

card has two nested elements: one to hold the timestamp and the link to   
edit the entry, and another to hold the body of the entry. The

card

selector

takes care of most of the styling we need for this div; we customize the card   
by adding a small margin to the bottom of each card (

mb-3

).

The first element in the card is a header, which is an

\<h4\>

element with

the selector

card-header

3

. This header contains the date the entry was

made and a link to edit the entry. The

\<small\>

tag around the

edit_entry

link

makes it appear a little smaller than the timestamp

4

. The second element

is a div with the selector

card-body

5

, which places the text of the entry in

a simple box on the card. Notice that the Django code for including the   
information on the page hasn't changed; only elements that affect the   
appearance of the page have. Since we no longer have an unordered list,   
we've replaced the list item tags around the empty list message with simple   
paragraph tags

6

.

Figure 20-3 shows the topic page with its new look. Learning Log's

functionality hasn't changed, but it looks significantly more professional   
and inviting to users.

If you want to use a different Bootstrap template for a project, follow a

process that's similar to what we've done so far in this chapter. Copy the tem-  
plate you want to use into *base.html* , and modify the elements that contain   
actual content so the template displays your project's information. Then use   
Bootstrap's individual styling tools to style the content on each page.

**Deploying Learning Log**

Now that we have a professional-looking project, let's deploy it to a live   
server so anyone with an internet connection can use it. We'll use Platform.sh,   
a web-based platform that allows you to manage the deployment of web   
applications. We'll get Learning Log up and running on Platform.sh.

***Making a Platform.sh Account***

To make an account, go t[o *https://platform.sh*](https://platform.sh) and click the **Free Trial** button.   
Platform.sh has a free tier that, as of this writing, does not require a credit   
card. The trial period allows you to deploy an app with minimal resources,   
which lets you test your project in a live deployment before committing to a   
paid hosting plan.

*fight spam and abuse of resources. You can see the current limits of the free trial at* <https://platform.sh/free-trial>*.*

***Installing the Platform.sh CLI***

To deploy and manage a project on Platform.sh, you'll need the tools avail-  
able in the Command Line Interface (CLI). To install the latest version   
of the CLI, visit [*https://docs.platform.sh/development/cli.html*](https://docs.platform.sh/development/cli.html) and follow the   
instructions for your operating system.

On most systems, you can install the CLI by running the following com-

mand in a terminal:

$ curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer \| php

After this command has finished running, you will need to open a new

terminal window before you can use the CLI.

**N O T E**

*This command will probably not work in a standard terminal on Windows. You*

*can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a Git Bash terminal. If you need to
install PHP, you can use the XAMPP installer from* [https://apachefriends.org*. I*](https://apachefriends.org)*f
you have any difficulty installing the Platform.sh CLI, see the more detailed installa-
tion instructions in [Appendix E](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#531)* *.*

***Installing platformshconfig***

You'll also need to install one additional package,

platformshconfig

. This

package helps detect whether the project is running on your local system or   
on a Platform.sh server. In an active virtual environment, issue the follow-  
ing command:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**pip install platformshconfig**

We'll use this package to modify the project's settings when it's running

on the live server.

***Creating a requirements.txt File***

The remote server needs to know which packages Learning Log depends   
on, so we'll use pip to generate a file listing them. Again, from an active vir-  
tual environment, issue the following command:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**pip freeze \> requirements.txt**

The

freeze

command tells pip to write the names of all the packages

currently installed in the project into the file *requirements.txt* . Open this file   
to see the packages and version numbers installed in your project:

*requirements.txt*

asgiref==3.5.2  
beautifulsoup4==4.11.1  
Django==4.1  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress485.png)

Styling and Deploying an App

**447**

django-bootstrap5==21.3  
platformshconfig==2.4.0  
soupsieve==2.3.2.post1  
sqlparse==0.4.2

Learning Log already depends on specific versions of seven differ-

ent packages, so it requires a matching environment to run properly on a   
remote server. (We installed three of these packages manually, and four of   
them were installed automatically as dependencies of these packages.)

When we deploy Learning Log, Platform.sh will install all the packages

listed in *requirements.txt* , creating an environment with the same packages   
we're using locally. Because of this, we can be confident the deployed project   
will function just like it has on our local system. This approach to managing   
a project is critical as you start to build and maintain multiple projects on   
your system.

**N O T E**

*If the version number for a package listed on your system differs from what's shown*

*here, keep the version you have on your system.*

***Additional Deployment Requirements***

The live server requires two additional packages. These packages are used   
to serve the project in a production environment, where many users can be   
making requests at the same time.

In the same directory where *requirements.txt* is saved, make a new file

called *requirements_remote.txt*. Add the following two packages to it:

*requirements*

*_remote.txt*

# Requirements for live project.  
gunicorn  
psycopg2

The

gunicorn

package responds to requests as they come in to the

remote server; this takes the place of the development server we've been   
using locally. The

psycopg2

package is required to let Django manage the

Postgres database that Platform.sh uses. *Postgres* is an open source database   
that's extremely well suited to production apps.

***Adding Configuration Files***

Every hosting platform requires some configuration for a project to run   
correctly on its servers. In this section, we'll add three configuration files:

***.platform.app.yaml***

This is the main configuration file for the project.

This tells Platform.sh what kind of project we're trying to deploy and   
what kinds of resources our project needs, and it includes commands   
for building the project on the server.  
***.platform/routes.yaml***

This file defines the routes to our project. When

a request is received by Platform.sh, this is the configuration that helps   
direct these requests to our specific project.  
***.platform/services.yaml***

This file defines any additional services our

project needs.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress486.png)

**448**

Chapter 20

These are all YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) files. *YAML* is

a language designed for writing configuration files; it's made to be read   
easily by both humans and computers. You can write or modify a typical   
YAML file by hand, but a computer can also read and interpret the file   
unambiguously.

YAML files are great for deployment configuration, because they give

you a good deal of control over what happens during the deployment   
process.

**Making Hidden Files Visible**

Most operating systems hide files and folders that begin with a dot, such as   
*.platform* . When you open a file browser, you won't see these kinds of files   
and folders by default. But as a programmer, you'll need to see them. Here's   
how to view hidden files, depending on your operating system:

â¢

On Windows, open Windows Explorer, and then open a folder such as   
*Desktop* . Click the **View** tab, and make sure **File name extensions** and   
**Hidden items** are checked.

â¢

On macOS, you can press

â

-SHIFT-. (dot) in any Finder window to see

hidden files and folders.

â¢

On Linux systems such as Ubuntu, you can press CTRL-H in any file   
browser to display hidden files and folders. To make this setting per-  
manent, open a file browser such as Nautilus and click the options tab   
(indicated by three lines). Select the **Show Hidden Files** checkbox.

**The .platform.app.yaml Configuration File**

The first configuration file is the longest, because it controls the overall   
deployment process. We'll show it in parts; you can either enter it by hand   
in your text editor or download a copy from the online resources at [*https://
ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e*.](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e)

Here's the first part of *.platform.app.yaml*, which should be saved in the

same directory as *manage.py*:

*.platform*

*.app.yaml*

1

name: "ll_project"

type: "python:3.10"

2

relationships:

database: "db:postgresql"

# The configuration of the app when it's exposed to the web.

3

web:

upstream:  
socket_family: unix  
commands:

4

start: "gunicorn -w 4 -b unix:$SOCKET ll_project.wsgi:application"

5

locations:

passthru: true  
"/static":  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress487.png)

Styling and Deploying an App

**449**

root: "static"  
expires: 1h  
allow: true

# The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).

6

disk: 512

When you save this file, make sure you include the dot at the beginning

of the filename. If you omit the dot, Platform.sh won't find the file and your   
project will not be deployed.

You don't need to understand everything in *.platform.app.yaml* at this

point; I'll highlight the most important parts of the configuration. The file   
starts off by specifying the

name

of the project, which we're calling

'll_project'

to be consistent with the name we used when starting the project

1

. We also

need to specify the version of Python we're using (3.10 at the time of this   
writing). You can find a list of supported versions at [*https://docs.platform.sh/
languages/python.html*](https://docs.platform.sh/languages/python.html).

Next is a section labeled

relationships

that defines other services the proj-

ect needs

2

. Here the only relationship is to a Postgres database. After that

is the

web

section

3

. The

commands:start

section tells Platform.sh what process

to use to serve incoming requests. Here we're specifying that

gunicorn

will

handle requests

4

. This command takes the place of the

python manage.py

runserver

command we've been using locally.

The

locations

section tells Platform.sh where to send incoming requests

5

.

Most requests should be passed through to

gunicorn

; our *urls.py* files will tell

gunicorn

exactly how to handle those requests. Requests for static files will be

handled separately and will be refreshed once an hour. The last line shows   
that we're requesting 512MB of disk space on one of Platform.sh's servers

6

.

The rest of [*.platform.app.yaml* i](.platform.app.yaml)s as follows:

*--snip--*

disk: 512

# Set a local read/write mount for logs.

1

mounts:

"logs":  
source: local  
source_path: logs

# The hooks executed at various points in the lifecycle of the application.

2

hooks:

build: \|

3

pip install --upgrade pip

pip install -r requirements.txt  
pip install -r requirements_remote.txt

mkdir logs

4

python manage.py collectstatic

rm -rf logs

5

deploy: \|

python manage.py migrate  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress488.png)

**450**

Chapter 20

The

mounts

section

1

lets us define directories where we can read and

write data while the project is running. This section defines a *logs/* directory   
for the deployed project.

The

hooks

section

2

defines actions that are taken at various points

during the deployment process. In the

build

section, we install all the pack-

ages that are required to serve the project in the live environment

3

. We

also run

collectstatic

4

, which collects all the static files needed for the

project into one place so they can be served efficiently.

Finally, in the

deploy

section

5

, we specify that migrations should be

run each time the project is deployed. In a simple project, this will have no   
effect when there have been no changes.

The other two configuration files are much shorter; let's write them now.

**The routes.yaml Configuration File**

A *route* is the path a request takes as it's processed by the server. When   
a request is received by Platform.sh, it needs to know where to send the   
request.

Make a new folder called *.platform* , in the same directory as *manage.py*.

Make sure you include the dot at the beginning of the name. Inside that   
folder, make a file called *routes.yaml* and enter the following:

*.platform/*

*routes.yaml*

# Each route describes how an incoming URL will be processed by Platform.sh.

"https://{default}/":  
type: upstream  
upstream: "ll_project:http"

"https://www.{default}/":  
type: redirect  
to: "https://{default}/"

This file makes sure requests like *https://project_url.com* and *www.project*

*_url.com* all get routed to the same place.

**The services.yaml Configuration File**

This last configuration file specifies services that our project needs in order   
to run. Save this file in the *.platform/* directory, alongside *routes.yaml*:

*.platform/*

*routes.yaml*

# Each service listed will be deployed in its own container as part of your  
# Platform.sh project.

db:  
type: postgresql:12  
disk: 1024

This file defines one service, a Postgres database.

**451**

***Modifying settings.py for Platform.sh***

Now we need to add a section at the end of *settings.py* to modify some settings   
for the Platform.sh environment. Add this code to the very end of *settings.py*:

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

# Platform.sh settings.

1

from platformshconfig import Config

config = Config()

2

if config.is_valid_platform():

3

ALLOWED_HOSTS.append('.platformsh.site')

4

if config.appDir:

STATIC_ROOT = Path(config.appDir) / 'static'

5

if config.projectEntropy:

SECRET_KEY = config.projectEntropy

if not config.in_build():

6

db_settings = config.credentials('database')

DATABASES = {  
'default': {  
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',  
'NAME': db_settings\['path'\],  
'USER': db_settings\['username'\],  
'PASSWORD': db_settings\['password'\],  
'HOST': db_settings\['host'\],  
'PORT': db_settings\['port'\],  
},  
}

We normally place

import

statements at the beginning of a module, but

in this case, it's helpful to keep all the remote-specific settings in one sec-  
tion. Here we import

Config

from

platformshconfig

1

, which helps determine

settings on the remote server. We only modify settings if the method

config

.is_valid_platform()

returns

True

2

, indicating the settings are being used

on a Platform.sh server.

We modify

ALLOWED_HOSTS

to allow the project to be served by hosts end-

ing in *.platformsh.site*

3

. All projects deployed to the free tier will be served

using this host. If settings are being loaded in the deployed app's direc-  
tory

4

, we set

STATIC_ROOT

so that static files are served correctly. We also set

a more secure

SECRET_KEY

on the remote server

5

.

Finally, we configure the production database

6

. This is only set if the

build process has finished running and the project is being served. Everything   
you see here is necessary to let Django talk to the Postgres server that   
Platform.sh set up for the project.

***Using Git to Track the Project's Files***

As discussed i[n Chapter 17](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#393), Git is a version control program that allows you   
to take a snapshot of the code in your project each time you implement a   
new feature successfully. If anything goes wrong, you can easily return to  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress490.png)

**452**

Chapter 20

the last working snapshot of your project; for example, if you accidentally   
introduce a bug while working on a new feature. Each snapshot is called a   
*commit*.

Using Git, you can try implementing new features without worrying

about breaking your project. When you're deploying to a live server, you   
need to make sure you're deploying a working version of your project. To   
read more about Git and version control, see [Appendix D](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#531).

**Installing Git**

Git may already be installed on your system. To find out, open a new termi-  
nal window and issue the command

**git --version**

:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git --version**

git version 2.30.1 (Apple Git-130)

If you get a message indicating that Git is not installed, see the installa-

tion instructions i[n Appendix D](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#531).

**Configuring Git**

Git keeps track of who makes changes to a project, even when only one per-  
son is working on the project. To do this, Git needs to know your username   
and email. You must provide a username, but you can make up an email for   
your practice projects:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git config --global user.name "eric"**

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git config --global user.email "eric@example.com"**

If you forget this step, Git will prompt you for this information when

you make your first commit.

**Ignoring Files**

We don't need Git to track every file in the project, so we'll tell it to ignore   
some files. Create a file called *.gitignore* in the folder that contains *manage.py* .   
Notice that this filename begins with a dot and has no file extension. Here's   
the code that goes in *.gitignore*:

*.gitignore*

ll_env/  
__pycache__/  
\*.sqlite3

We tell Git to ignore the entire *ll_env* directory, because we can re-create

it automatically at any time. We also don't track the *__pycache__* directory,   
which contains the *.pyc* files that are created automatically when the *.py* files   
are executed. We don't track changes to the local database, because it's a   
bad habit: if you're ever using SQLite on a server, you might accidentally   
overwrite the live database with your local test database when you push the   
project to the server. The asterisk in

\*.sqlite3

tells Git to ignore any file that

ends with the extension *.sqlite3*.

**453**

**N O T E**

*If you're using macOS, add*

*.DS_Store*

*to your* .gitignore*file. This is a file that*

*stores information about folder settings on macOS, and it has nothing to do with this
project.*

**Committing the Project**

We need to initialize a Git repository for Learning Log, add all the nec-  
essary files to the repository, and commit the initial state of the project.   
Here's how to do that:

1

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git init**

Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/eric/.../learning_log/.git/

2

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git add .**

3

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git commit -am "Ready for deployment to Platform.sh."**

\[main (root-commit) c7ffaad\] Ready for deployment to Platform.sh.  
42 files changed, 879 insertions(+)  
create mode 100644 .gitignore  
create mode 100644 .platform.app.yaml

*--snip--*

create mode 100644 requirements_remote.txt

4

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working tree clean  
(ll_env)learning_log$

We issue the

git init

command to initialize an empty repository in the

directory containing Learning Log

1

. We then use the

git add .

command,

which adds all the files that aren't being ignored to the repository

2

. (Don't

forget the dot.) Next, we issue the command

git commit -am

"

*commit message*

"

:

the

-a

flag tells Git to include all changed files in this commit, and the

-m

flag tells Git to record a log message

3

.

Issuing the

git status

command

4

indicates that we're on the *main*

branch and that our working tree is *clean* . This is the status you'll want to   
see anytime you push your project to a remote server.

***Creating a Project on Platform.sh***

At this point, the Learning Log project still runs on our local system and is   
also configured to run correctly on a remote server. We'll use the Platform.sh   
CLI to create a new project on the server and then push our project to the   
remote server.

Make sure you're in a terminal, at the *learning_log/* directory, and issue

the following command:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**platform login**

Opened URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000  
Please use the browser to log in.

*--snip--*

1

Do you want to create an SSH configuration file automatically? \[Y/n\]

**Y**  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress492.png)

**454**

Chapter 20

This command will open a browser tab where you can log in. Once

you're logged in, you can close the browser tab and return to the terminal.   
If you're prompted about creating an SSH configuration file

1

, enter

**Y**

so

you can connect to the remote server later.

Now we'll create a project. There's a lot of output, so we'll look at the

creation process in sections. Start by issuing the

**create**

command:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**platform create**

\* Project title (--title)  
Default: Untitled Project

1

\>

**ll_project**

\* Region (--region)  
The region where the project will be hosted  

*--snip--*

\[us-3.platform.sh\] Moses Lake, United States (AZURE) \[514 gC02eq/kWh\]

2

\>

**us-3.platform.sh**

\* Plan (--plan)  
Default: development  
Enter a number to choose:  
\[0\] development  

*--snip--*

3

\>

**0**

\* Environments (--environments)  
The number of environments  
Default: 3

4

\>

**3**

\* Storage (--storage)  
The amount of storage per environment, in GiB  
Default: 5

5

\>

**5**

The first prompt asks for a name for the project

1

, so we use the name

**ll_project**

. The next prompt asks which region we'd like the server to be

in

2

. Choose the server closest to you; for me, that's

us-3.platform.sh

. For

the rest of the prompts, you can accept the defaults: a server on the lowest   
development plan

3

, three environments for the project

4

, and 5GB of

storage for the overall project

5

.

There are three more prompts to respond to:

Default branch (--default-branch)  
The default Git branch name for the project (the production environment)  
Default: main

1

\>

**main**

Git repository detected: /Users/eric/.../learning_log

2

Set the new project ll_project as the remote for this repository? \[Y/n\]

**Y**

The estimated monthly cost of this project is: $10 USD

3

Are you sure you want to continue? \[Y/n\]

**Y**

ââ

The project is now ready!

A Git repository can have multiple branches; Platform.sh is asking us if

the default branch for the project should be

main

1

. It then asks if we want

to connect the local project's repository to the remote repository

2

. Finally,

we're informed that this project will cost about $10 per month if we keep   
it running beyond the free trial period

3

. If you haven't entered a credit

card yet, you shouldn't have to worry about this cost. Platform.sh will simply   
suspend your project if you exceed the free trial's limits without adding a   
credit card.

***Pushing to Platform.sh***

The last step before seeing the live version of the project is to push our code   
to the remote server. To do that, issue the following command:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**platform push**

1

Are you sure you want to push to the main (production) branch? \[Y/n\]

**Y**

*--snip--*

The authenticity of host 'git.us-3.platform.sh (...)' can't be established.  
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Tvn...7PM

2

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/\[fingerprint\])?

**Y**

Pushing HEAD to the existing environment main  

*--snip--*

To git.us-3.platform.sh:3pp3mqcexhlvy.git  
\* \[new branch\] HEAD -\> main

When you issue the command

**platform push**

, you'll be asked for one

more confirmation that you want to push the project

1

. You may also see a

message about the authenticity of Platform.sh, if this is your first time con-  
necting to the site

2

. Enter

**Y**

for each of these prompts, and you'll see a

bunch of output scroll by. This output will probably look confusing at first,   
but if anything goes wrong, it's really useful to have during troubleshooting.   
If you skim through the output, you can see where Platform.sh installs nec-  
essary packages, collects static files, applies migrations, and sets up URLs   
for the project.

**N O T E**

*You may see an error from something that you can easily diagnose, such as a typo*

*in one of the configuration files. If this happens, fix the error in your text editor,
save the file, and reissue the*

***git commit***

*command. Then you can run*

***platform***

***push***

*again.*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress494.png)

**456**

Chapter 20

***Viewing the Live Project***

Once the push is complete, you can open the project:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**platform url**

Enter a number to open a URL  
\[0\] https://main-bvxea6i-wmye2fx7wwqgu.us-3.platformsh.site/  

*--snip--*

\>

**0**

The

platform url

command lists the URLs associated with a deployed

project; you'll be given a choice of several URLs that are all valid for your   
project. Choose one, and your project should open in a new browser tab!   
This will look just like the project we've been running locally, but you can   
share this URL with anyone in the world, and they can access and use your   
project.

**N O T E**

*When you deploy your project using a trial account, don't be surprised if it sometimes*

*takes longer than usual for a page to load. On most hosting platforms, free resources
that are idle are often suspended and only restarted when new requests come in. Most
platforms are much more responsive on paid hosting plans.*

***Refining the Platform.sh Deployment***

Now we'll refine the deployment by creating a superuser, just as we did locally.   
We'll also make the project more secure by changing the setting

DEBUG

to

False

,

so error messages won't show users any extra information that they could use   
to attack the server.

**Creating a Superuser on Platform.sh**

The database for the live project has been set up, but it's completely empty.   
All the users we created earlier only exist in our local version of the project.

To create a superuser on the live version of the project, we'll start an

SSH (secure socket shell) session where we can run management com-  
mands on the remote server:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**platform environment:ssh**

___ _ _ __ _  
\| _ \\ \|__ _\| \|_ / _\|___ _ _ _ __ __\| \|_  
\| _/ / _\` \| _\| _/ _ \\ '_\| ' \\ _(_-\< ' \\

(ll_env)learning_log$

When you first run the

**platform environment:ssh**

command, you may get

another prompt about the authenticity of this host. If you see this message,   
enter

**Y**

and you should be logged in to a remote terminal session.

After running the

**ssh**

command, your terminal acts just like a terminal on

the remote server. Note that your prompt has changed to indicate that you're   
in a

web

session associated with the project named

ll_project

1

. If you issue

the

**ls**

command, you'll see the files that have been pushed to the Platform.sh

server.

Issue the same

**createsuperuser**

command we used in [Chapter 18](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#411)

2

. This

time, I entered an admin username,

**ll_admin_live**

, that's distinct from the

one I used locally

3

. When you're finished working in the remote terminal

session, enter the

**exit**

command

4

. Your prompt will indicate that you're

working in your local system again

5

.

Now you can add */admin/* to the end of the URL for the live app and

log in to the admin site. If others have already started using your project, be   
aware that you'll have access to all their data! Take this responsibility seri-  
ously, and users will continue to trust you with their data.

**N O T E**

*Windows users will use the same commands shown here (such as*

*ls*

*instead of*

*dir*

*),*

*because you're running a Linux terminal through a remote connection.*

**Securing the Live Project**

There's one glaring security issue in the way our project is currently deployed:   
the setting

DEBUG = True

in *settings.py*, which provides debug messages when

errors occur. Django's error pages give you vital debugging information when   
you're developing a project; however, they give way too much information to   
attackers if you leave them enabled on a live server.

To see how bad this is, go to the home page of your deployed project.

Log in to a user's account and add */topics/999/* to the end of the home page   
URL. Assuming you haven't made thousands of topics, you should see a   
page with the message *DoesNotExist at /topics/999/* . If you scroll down, you   
should see a whole bunch of information about the project and the server.   
You won't want your users to see this, and you certainly wouldn't want this   
information available to anyone interested in attacking the site.

We can prevent this information from being shown on the live site

by setting

DEBUG = False

in the part of *settings.py* that only applies to the

deployed version of the project. This way you'll continue to see debugging   
information locally, where that information is useful, but it won't show up   
on the live site.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress496.png)

**458**

Chapter 20

Open *settings.py* in your text editor, and add one line of code to the part

that modifies settings for Platform.sh:

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

if config.is_valid_platform():  
ALLOWED_HOSTS.append('.platformsh.site')

DEBUG = False  

*--snip--*

All the work to set up configuration for the deployed version of the

project has paid off. When we want to adjust the live version of the project,   
we just change the relevant part of the configuration we set up earlier.

**Committing and Pushing Changes**

Now we need to commit the changes made to *settings.py* and push the   
changes to Platform.sh. Here's a terminal session showing the first part of   
this process:

1

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git commit -am "Set DEBUG False on live site."**

\[main d2ad0f7\] Set DEBUG False on live site.  
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

2

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working tree clean  
(ll_env)learning_log$

We issue the

git commit

command with a short but descriptive commit

message

1

. Remember the

-am

flag makes sure Git commits all the files that

have changed and records the log message. Git recognizes that one file has   
changed and commits this change to the repository.

Running

**git status**

shows that we're working on the

main

branch of the

repository and that there are now no new changes to commit

2

. It's impor-

tant to check the status before pushing to a remote server. If you don't see a   
clean status, then some changes haven't been committed and those changes   
won't be pushed to the server. You can try issuing the

commit

command

again; if you're not sure how to resolve the issue, read throug[h Appendix D](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#531)   
to better understand how to work with Git.

Now let's push the updated repository to Platform.sh:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**platform push**

Are you sure you want to push to the main (production) branch? \[Y/n\]

**Y**

Pushing HEAD to the existing environment main

*--snip--*

To git.us-3.platform.sh:wmye2fx7wwqgu.git  
fce0206..d2ad0f7 HEAD -\> main  
(ll_env)learning_log$

Platform.sh recognizes that the repository has been updated, and it

rebuilds the project to make sure all the changes have been taken into   
account. It doesn't rebuild the database, so we haven't lost any data.

**459**

To make sure this change took effect, visit the [*/topics/999/*](/topics/999/) URL again.

You should see just the message *Server Error (500)* , with no sensitive informa-  
tion about the project at all.

***Creating Custom Error Pages***

I[n Chapter 19](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#441), we configured Learning Log to return a 404 error if the user   
requests a topic or entry that doesn't belong to them. Now you've seen   
a 500 server error as well. A 404 error usually means your Django code   
is correct, but the object being requested doesn't exist. A 500 error usu-  
ally means there's an error in the code you've written, such as an error in   
a function in *views.py* . Django currently returns the same generic error   
page in both situations, but we can write our own 404 and 500 error page   
templates that match Learning Log's overall appearance. These templates   
belong in the root template directory.

**Making Custom Templates**

In the *learning_log* folder, make a new folder called *templates* . Then make   
a new file called *404.html* ; the path to this file should be *learning_log/
templates/404.html*. Here's the code for this file:

*404.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

{% block page_header %}  
\<h2\>The item you requested is not available. (404)\</h2\>  
{% endblock page_header %}

This simple template provides the generic 404 error page information

but is styled to match the rest of the site.

Make another file called *500.html* using the following code:

*500.html*

{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}

{% block page_header %}  
\<h2\>There has been an internal error. (500)\</h2\>  
{% endblock page_header %}

These new files require a slight change to *settings.py*.

*settings.py*

*--snip--*

TEMPLATES = \[  
{  
'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',

'DIRS': \[BASE_DIR / 'templates'\],

'APP_DIRS': True,  

*--snip--*

},  
\]

*--snip--*  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress498.png)

**460**

Chapter 20

This change tells Django to look in the root template directory for the

error page templates and any other templates that aren't associated with a   
particular app.

**Pushing the Changes to Platform.sh**

Now we need to commit the changes we just made and push them to   
Platform.sh:

1

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git add .**

2

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git commit -am "Added custom 404 and 500 error pages."**

3 files changed, 11 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)  
create mode 100644 templates/404.html  
create mode 100644 templates/500.html

3

(ll_env)learning_log$

**platform push**

*--snip--*

To git.us-3.platform.sh:wmye2fx7wwqgu.git  
d2ad0f7..9f042ef HEAD -\> main  
(ll_env)learning_log$

We issue the

git add .

command

1

because we created some new files

in the project. Then we commit the changes

2

and push the updated proj-

ect to Platform.sh

3

.

Now when an error page appears, it should have the same styling as the

rest of the site, making for a smoother user experience when errors arise.

***Ongoing Development***

You might want to further develop Learning Log after your initial push to a   
live server, or you might want to develop your own projects to deploy. When   
doing so, there's a fairly consistent process for updating your projects.

First, you'll make the necessary changes to your local project. If your

changes result in any new files, add those files to the Git repository using   
the command

git add .

(making sure to include the dot at the end of the

command). Any change that requires a database migration will need this   
command, because each migration generates a new migration file.

Second, commit the changes to your repository using

git commit -am

"

*commit message*

"

. Then push your changes to Platform.sh, using the com-

mand

platform push

. Visit your live project and make sure the changes you

expect to see have taken effect.

It's easy to make mistakes during this process, so don't be surprised

when something goes wrong. If the code doesn't work, review what you've   
done and try to spot the mistake. If you can't find the mistake or you   
can't figure out how to undo it, refer to the suggestions for getting help in   
[Appendix C. D](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#515)on't be shy about asking for help: everyone else learned to build   
projects by asking the same questions you're likely to ask, so someone will be   
happy to help you. Solving each problem that arises helps you steadily develop   
your skills until you're building meaningful, reliable projects and answering   
other people's questions as well.

***Deleting a Project on Platform.sh***

It's great practice to run through the deployment process a number of   
times with the same project or with a series of small projects, to get the   
hang of deployment. But you'll need to know how to delete a project that's   
been deployed. Platform.sh also limits the number of projects you can host   
for free, and you don't want to clutter your account with practice projects.

You can delete a project using the CLI:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**platform project:delete**

You'll be asked to confirm that you want to take this destructive action.

Respond to the prompts, and your project will be deleted.

The command

platform create

also gave the local Git repository a refer-

ence to the remote repository on Platform.sh's servers. You can remove this   
remote from the command line as well:

(ll_env)learning_log$

**git remote**

platform  
(ll_env)learning_log$

**git remote remove platform**

The command

git remote

lists the names of all remote URLs associated

with the current repository. The command

git remote remove

*remote_name*

deletes these remote URLs from the local repository.

You can also delete a project's resources by logging in to the Platform.sh

website and visiting your dashboard a[t *https://console.platform.sh*](https://console.platform.sh). This page   
lists all your active projects. Click the three dots in a project's box, and click   
**Edit Plan** . This is a pricing page for the project; click the **Delete Project**   
button at the bottom of the page, and you'll be shown a confirmation page   
where you can follow through with the deletion. Even if you deleted your   
project using the CLI, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the dash-  
board of any hosting provider you deploy to.

**N O T E**

*Deleting a project on Platform.sh does nothing to your local version of the project.*

*If no one has used your deployed project and you're just practicing the deployment
process, it's perfectly reasonable to delete your project on Platform.sh and redeploy it.
Just be aware that if things stop working, you may have run into the host's free-tier
limitations.*

**TRY IT YOURSELF**

**20-3. Live Blog:**

Deploy the Blog project you've been working on to Platform.sh.

Make sure you set

DEBUG

to

False

, so users don't see the full Django error pages

when something goes wrong.

Chapter 20

**20-4. Extended Learning Log:**

Add one feature to Learning Log, and push the

change to your live deployment. Try a simple change, such as writing more   
about the project on the home page. Then try adding a more advanced feature,   
such as giving users the option of making a topic public. This would require an   
attribute called

public

as part of the

Topic

model (this should be set to

False

by default) and a form element on the new_topic page that allows the user to   
change a topic from private to public. You'd then need to migrate the project   
and revise

*views.py*

so any topic that's public is visible to unauthenticated users

as well.

**Summary**

In this chapter, you learned to give your projects a simple but professional   
appearance using the Bootstrap library and the django-bootstrap5 app.   
With Bootstrap, the styles you choose will work consistently on almost any   
device people use to access your project.

You learned about Bootstrap's templates and used the *Navbar static* tem-

plate to create a simple look and feel for Learning Log. You used a jumbo-  
tron to make a home page's message stand out, and learned to style all the   
pages in a site consistently.

In the final part of the project, you learned how to deploy a project to

a remote server so anyone can access it. You made a Platform.sh account   
and installed some tools that help manage the deployment process. You   
used Git to commit the working project to a repository, and then pushed   
the repository to a remote server on Platform.sh. Finally, you learned to   
begin securing your app by setting

DEBUG = False

on the live server. You also

made custom error pages, so the inevitable errors that come up will look   
well-handled.

Now that you've finished Learning Log, you can start building your own

projects. Start simple, and make sure the project works before adding com-  
plexity. Enjoy your continued learning, and good luck with your projects!

**T R O U B L E S H O O T I N G**

There are many versions of Python avail-

able and numerous ways to set it up on

each operating system. If the approach in

[Chapter 1 d](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#41)idn't work, or if you want to install

a different version of Python than the one currently   
installed, the instructions in this appendix can help.

**Python on Windows**

The instructions i[n Chapter 1 s](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#41)how you how to install Python using the   
official installer at [*https://python.org*. I](https://python.org)f you couldn't get Python to run after   
using the installer, the troubleshooting instructions in this section should   
help you get Python up and running.

***Using py Instead of python***

If you run a recent Python installer and then issue the command

**python**

in

a terminal, you should see the Python prompt for a terminal session (

\>\>\>

).  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress502.png)

Appendix A

When Windows doesn't recognize the

python

command, it will either open

the Microsoft Store because it thinks Python isn't installed, or you'll get a   
message such as "Python was not found." If the Microsoft Store opens, close   
it; it's better to use the official Python installer from [*https://python.org*](https://python.org) than   
the one that Microsoft maintains.

The simplest solution, without making any changes to your system, is to

try the

**py**

command. This is a Windows utility that finds the latest version of

Python installed on your system and runs that interpreter. If this command   
works and you want to use it, simply use

**py**

anywhere you see the

python

or

python3

command in this book.

***Rerunning the Installer***

The most common reason

python

doesn't work is that people forget to select

the Add Python to PATH option when running the installer; this is an   
easy mistake to make. The

PATH

variable is a system setting that tells Python

where to look for commonly used programs. In this case, Windows doesn't   
know how to find the Python interpreter.

The simplest fix in this situation is to run the installer again. If there's a

newer installer available from [*https://python.org*, d](https://python.org)ownload the new installer   
and run it, making sure to check the **Add Python to PATH** box.

If you already have the latest installer, run it again and select the **Modify**

option. You'll see a list of optional features; keep the default options selected   
on this screen. Then click **Next** and check the **Add Python to Environment
Variables** box. Finally, click **Install** . The installer will recognize that Python is   
already installed, and it will add the location of the Python interpreter to the

PATH

variable. Make sure you close any open terminals, because they'll still be

using the old

PATH

variable. Open a new terminal window and issue the com-

mand

**python**

again; you should see a Python prompt (

\>\>\>

).

**Python on macOS**

The installation instructions in [Chapter 1](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#41) use the official Python installer   
at[*https://python.org*. T](https://python.org)he official installer has been working well for years   
now, but there are a few things that can get you off track. This section will   
help if anything isn't working in a straightforward manner.

***Accidentally Installing Apple's Version of Python***

If you run the

python3

command and Python is not yet installed on your

system, you'll most likely see a message that the *command line developer tools*   
need to be installed. The best approach at this point is to close the pop-up   
showing this message, download the Python installer fro[m *https://python.org* ,](https://python.org)and run the installer.

If you choose to install the command line developer tools at this point,

macOS will install Apple's version of Python along with the developer tools.   
The only issue with this is that Apple's version of Python is usually some-  
what behind the latest official version of Python. However, you can still   
download and run the official installer fro[m *https://python.org*, a](https://python.org)nd

python3

![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress503.png)

Installation and Troubleshooting

**465**

will then point to the newer version. Don't worry about having the devel-  
oper tools installed; there are some useful tools in there, including the Git   
version control system discussed i[n Appendix D](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#521).

***Python 2 on Older Versions of macOS***

On older versions of macOS, before Monterey (macOS 12), an outdated ver-  
sion of Python 2 was installed by default. On these systems, the command

python

points to the outdated system interpreter. If you're using a version of

macOS with Python 2 installed, make sure you use the

**python3**

command,

and you'll always be using the version of Python you installed.

**Python on Linux**

Python is included by default on almost every Linux system. However, if the   
default version on your system is earlier than Python 3.9, you should install   
the latest version. You can also install the latest version if you want the most   
recent features, like Python's improved error messages. The following instruc-  
tions should work for most apt-based systems.

***Using the Default Python Installation***

If you want to use the version of Python that

python3

points to, make sure

you have these three additional packages installed:

$

**sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv**

These packages include tools that are useful for developers and tools

that let you install third-party packages, like the ones used in the projects   
section of this book.

***Installing the Latest Version of Python***

We'll use a package called

deadsnakes

, which makes it easy to install multiple

versions of Python. Enter the following commands:

$

**sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa**

$

**sudo apt update**

$

**sudo apt install python3.11**

These commands will install Python 3.11 onto your system.  
Enter the following command to start a terminal session that runs

Python 3.11:

$

**python3.11**

\>\>\>

Anywhere you see the command

python

in this book, use

**python3.11**

instead. You'll also want to use this command when you run programs   
from the terminal.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress504.png)

**466**

Appendix A

You'll need to install two more packages to make the most of your Python

installation:

$

**sudo apt install python3.11-dev python3.11-venv**

These packages include modules you'll need when installing and run-

ning third-party packages, like the ones used in the projects in the second   
half of the book.

**N O T E**

*The*

*deadsnakes*

*package has been actively maintained for a long time. When newer*

*versions of Python come out, you can use these same commands, replacing*

*python3.11*

*with the latest version currently available.*

**Checking Which Version of Python You're Using**

If you're having any issues running Python or installing additional pack-  
ages, it can be helpful to know exactly which version of Python you're using.   
You may have multiple versions of Python installed and not be clear about   
which version is currently being used.

Issue the following command in a terminal:

$

**python --version**

Python 3.11.0

This tells you exactly which version the command

python

is currently

pointing to. The shorter command

python -V

will give the same output.

**Python Keywords and Built-in Functions**

Python comes with its own set of keywords and built-in functions. It's impor-  
tant to be aware of these when you're naming things in Python: your names   
cannot be the same as these keywords and shouldn't be the same as the   
function names, or you'll overwrite the functions.

In this section, we'll list Python's keywords and built-in function names,

so you'll know which names to avoid.

***Python Keywords***

Each of the following keywords has a specific meaning, and you'll see an   
error if you try to use any of them as a variable name.

False await else import pass  
None break except in raise  
True class finally is return  
and continue for lambda try  
as def from nonlocal while  
assert del global not with  
async elif if or yield

Installation and Troubleshooting

**467**

***Python Built-in Functions***

You won't get an error if you use one of the following readily available built-  
in functions as a variable name, but you'll override the behavior of that   
function:

abs() complex() hash() min() slice()  
aiter() delattr() help() next() sorted()  
all() dict() hex() object() staticmethod()  
any() dir() id() oct() str()

reading, and editing code, and using a text

editor or an IDE (integrated development

environment) to make this work as efficient as

possible is essential. A good editor will do simple tasks,   
like highlighting your code's structure so you can catch   
common bugs as you're working. But it won't do so

much that it distracts you from your thinking. Editors also have useful fea-  
tures like automatic indenting, markers to show appropriate line length,   
and keyboard shortcuts for common operations.

An *IDE* is a text editor with a number of other tools included, like inter-

active debuggers and code introspection. An IDE examines your code as   
you enter it and tries to learn about the project you're building. For example,   
when you start typing the name of a function, an IDE might show you all   
the arguments that function accepts. This behavior can be very helpful   
when everything works and you understand what you're seeing. But it can

also be overwhelming as a beginner and difficult to troubleshoot when you   
aren't sure why your code isn't working in the IDE.

These days, the lines have blurred between text editors and IDEs. Most

popular editors have some features that used to be exclusive to IDEs. Likewise,   
most IDEs can be configured to run in a lighter mode that's less distracting as   
you work, but lets you use the more advanced features when you need them.

If you already have an editor or IDE installed that you like, and if it's

already configured to work with a recent version of Python that's installed   
on your system, then I encourage you to stick with what you already know.   
Exploring different editors can be fun, but it's also a way to avoid the work   
of learning a new language.

If you don't already have an editor or IDE installed, I recommend

VS Code for a number of reasons:

â¢

It's free, and it's released under an open source license.

â¢

It can be installed on all major operating systems.

â¢

It's beginner-friendly but also powerful enough that many professional   
programmers use it as their main editor.

â¢

It finds the versions of Python you have installed, and it typically does   
not require any configuration to run your first programs.

â¢

It has an integrated terminal, so your output appears in the same win-  
dow as your code.

â¢

A Python extension is available that makes the editor highly efficient   
for writing and maintaining Python code.

â¢

It's highly customizable, so you can tune it to match the way you work   
with code.

In this appendix, you'll learn how to start configuring VS Code so that

it works well for you. You'll also learn some shortcuts that let you work more   
efficiently. Being a fast typist is not as important as many people think in   
programming, but understanding your editor and knowing how to use it   
efficiently is quite helpful.

With all that said, VS Code doesn't work for everyone. If it doesn't work

well on your system for some reason, or if it's distracting you as you work,   
there are a number of other editors that you might find more appealing.   
This appendix includes a brief description of some of the other editors and   
IDEs you should consider.

**Working Efficiently with VS Code**

In [Chapter 1](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#41), you installed VS Code and added the Python extension as   
well. This section will show you some further configurations you can make,   
plus shortcuts for working efficiently with your code.

***Configuring VS Code***

There are a few ways to change the default configuration settings for VS Code.   
Some changes can be made through the interface, and some will require  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress509.png)

Text Editors and IDEs

**471**

changes in configuration files. These changes will sometimes take effect for   
everything you do in VS Code, while others will affect only the files within   
the folder that contains the configuration file.

For example, if you have a configuration file in your *python_work* folder,

those settings will only affect the files in that folder (and its subfolders).   
This is a good feature, because it means you can have project-specific set-  
tings that override your global settings.

**Using Tabs and Spaces**

If you use a mix of tabs and spaces in your code, it can cause problems in   
your programs that are difficult to diagnose. When working in a *.py* file with   
the Python extension installed, VS Code is configured to insert four spaces   
whenever you press the TAB key. If you're writing only your own code and   
you have the Python extension installed, you'll likely never have an issue   
with tabs and spaces.

However, your installation of VS Code may not be configured correctly.

Also, at some point, you may end up working on a file that has only tabs or a   
mix of tabs and spaces. If you suspect any issue with tabs and spaces, look at   
the status bar at the bottom of the VS Code window and click either **Spaces**   
or **Tab Size** . A drop-down menu will appear that lets you switch between   
using tabs and using spaces. You can also change the default indentation   
level and convert all indentation in the file to either tabs or spaces.

If you're looking at some code and you're not sure whether the indenta-

tion consists of tabs or spaces, highlight several lines of code. This will make   
the invisible whitespace characters visible. Each space will show up as a dot,   
and each tab will show up as an arrow.

**N O T E**

*In programming, spaces are preferred over tabs because spaces can be interpreted*

*unambiguously by all tools that work with a code file. The width of tabs can be inter-
preted differently by different tools, which leads to errors that can be extremely difficult
to diagnose.*

**Changing the Color Theme**

VS Code uses a dark theme by default. If you want to change this, click **File**   
(**Code** in the menu bar on macOS), then click **Preferences** and choose   
**Color Theme** . A drop-down list will appear, and it will let you choose a   
theme that works well for you.

**Setting the Line Length Indicator**

Most editors allow you to set up a visual cue, usually a vertical line, to show   
where your lines should end. In the Python community, the convention is to   
limit lines to 79 characters or less.

To set this feature, click **Code** and then **Preferences**, and then choose

**Settings**. In the dialog that appears, enter

**rulers**

. You'll see a setting for  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress510.png)

**472**

Appendix B

Editor: Rulers; click the link labeled *Edit in settings.json* . In the file that   
appears, add the following to the

editor.rulers

setting:

*settings.json*

"editor.rulers": \[

80,

\]

This will add a vertical line in the editing window at the 80-character

position. You can have more than one vertical line; for example, if you want   
an additional line at 120 characters, the value for your setting would be

\[80, 120\]

. If you don't see the vertical lines, make sure you saved the settings

file; you may also need to quit and reopen VS Code for the changes to take   
effect on some systems.

**Simplifying the Output**

By default, VS Code shows the output of your programs in an embedded   
terminal window. This output includes the commands that are being used   
to run the file. For many situations, this is ideal, but it might be more dis-  
tracting than you want when you're first learning Python.

To simplify the output, close all the tabs that are open in VS Code and

then quit VS Code. Launch VS Code again and open the folder that con-  
tains the Python files you're working on; this could just be the *python_work*   
folder where *hello_world.py* is saved.

Click the Run/Debug icon (which looks like a triangle with a small

bug), and then click **Create a** ***launch.json*** **File** . Select the Python options in   
the prompts that appear. In the *launch.json* file that opens, make the follow-  
ing change:

*launch.json*

{  

*--snip--*

"configurations": \[  
{  

*--snip--*

"console": "internalConsole",

"justMyCode": true  
}  
\]  
}

Here, we're changing the

console

setting from

integratedTerminal

to

internalConsole

. After saving the settings file, open a *.py* file such as *hello*

*_world.py* , and run it by pressing CTRL-F5. In the output pane of VS Code, click   
**Debug Console** if it's not already selected. You should see only your program's   
output, and the output should be refreshed every time you run a program.

**N O T E**

*The Debug Console is read-only. It won't work for files that use the*

*input()*

*function,*

*which you'll start using in [Chapter 7](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#151)* *. When you need to run these programs, you can
either change the*

*console*

*setting back to the default*

*integratedTerminal*

*, or you can*

*run these programs in a separate terminal window as described in "[Running Python
Programs from a Terminal](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#49)* *" o[n page 11.](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#49)*

Text Editors and IDEs

**473**

**Exploring Further Customizations**

You can customize VS Code in many ways to help you work more efficiently. To   
start exploring the customizations available, click **Code** and then **Preferences** ,   
and then choose **Settings** . You'll see a list titled Commonly Used; click any of   
the subheadings to see some common ways you can modify your installation   
of VS Code. Take some time to see if there are any that make VS Code work   
better for you, but don't get so lost in configuring your editor that you put off   
learning how to use Python!

***VS Code Shortcuts***

All editors and IDEs offer efficient ways to do common tasks that everyone   
needs to do when writing and maintaining code. For example, you can eas-  
ily indent a single line of code or an entire block of code; you can just as   
easily move a block of lines up or down in a file.

There are too many shortcuts to describe fully here. This section will

share just a few that you'll likely find helpful as you're writing your first   
Python files. If you end up using a different editor than VS Code, make sure   
you learn how to do these same tasks efficiently in the editor you've chosen.

**Indenting and Unindenting Code Blocks**

To indent an entire block of code, highlight it and press CTRL-\], or

â

-\] on

macOS. To unindent a block of code, highlight it and press CTRL-\[, or

â

-\[

on macOS.

**Commenting Out Blocks of Code**

To temporarily disable a block of code, you can highlight the block and   
comment it so Python will ignore it. Highlight the section of code you want   
to ignore and press CTRL-/, or

â

-/ on macOS. The selected lines will

be commented out with a hash mark (

#

) indented at the same level as the

line of code, to indicate these are not regular comments. When you want   
to uncomment the block of code, highlight the block and reissue the same   
command.

**Moving Lines Up or Down**

As your programs grow more complex, you may find that you want to move a   
block of code up or down within a file. To do so, highlight the code you want   
to move and press ALT-up arrow, or Option-up arrow on macOS. The same   
key combination with the down arrow will move the block down in the file.

If you're moving a single line up or down, you can click anywhere in

that line; you don't need to highlight the whole line to move it.

**Hiding the File Explorer**

The integrated file explorer in VS Code is really convenient. However, it can   
be distracting when you're writing code and can take up valuable space on   
a smaller screen. The command CTRL-B, or

â

-B on macOS, toggles the

visibility of the file explorer pane.

Appendix B

**Finding Additional Shortcuts**

Working efficiently in an editing environment takes practice, but it also   
takes intention. When you're learning to work with code, try to notice the   
things you do repeatedly. Any action you take in your editor likely has a   
shortcut; if you're clicking menu items to carry out editing tasks, look for   
the shortcuts for those actions. If you're switching between your keyboard   
and mouse frequently, look for the navigation shortcuts that keep you from   
reaching for your mouse so often.

You can see all the keyboard shortcuts in VS Code by clicking **Code** and

then **Preferences** , and then choosing **Keyboard** **Shortcuts** . You can use the   
search bar to find a particular shortcut, or you can scroll through the list to   
find shortcuts that might help you work more efficiently.

Remember, it's better to focus on the code that you're working on, and

avoid spending too much time on the tools you're using.

**Other Text Editors and IDEs**

You'll hear about and see people using a number of other text editors. Most   
of them can be configured to help you in the same way you've customized   
VS Code. Here's a small selection of text editors you might hear about.

***IDLE***

*IDLE* is a text editor that's included with Python. It's a little less intuitive to   
work with than other, more modern editors. However, you'll see references   
to it in other tutorials aimed at beginners, so you might want to give it a try.

***Geany***

*Geany* is a simple text editor that displays all of your output in a separate ter-  
minal window, which helps you become comfortable using terminals. Geany   
has a very minimalist interface, but it's powerful enough that a significant   
number of experienced programmers still use it.

If you find VS Code too distracting and full of too many features, con-

sider using Geany instead.

***Sublime Text***

*Sublime Text* is another minimalist editor that you should consider using if   
you find VS Code too busy. Sublime Text has a really clean interface and is   
known for working well even on very large files. It's an editor that will get   
out of your way and let you focus on the code you're writing.

Sublime Text has an unlimited free trial, but it's not free or open

source. If you decide you like it and can afford to purchase a full license,   
you should do so. The purchase is a one-time fee; it's not a software   
subscription.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress513.png)

Text Editors and IDEs

**475**

***Emacs and Vim***

*Emacs* and *Vim* are two popular editors favored by many experienced pro-  
grammers, because they're designed so you can use them without your   
hands ever having to leave the keyboard. This makes writing, reading, and   
modifying code very efficient, once you learn how the editor works. It also   
means both editors have a fairly steep learning curve. Vim is included on   
most Linux and macOS machines, and both Emacs and Vim can be run   
entirely inside a terminal. For this reason, they're often used to write code   
on servers through remote terminal sessions.

Programmers will often recommend that you give them a try, but many

proficient programmers forget how much new programmers are already   
trying to learn. It's good to be aware of these editors, but you should hold   
off on using them until you're comfortable working with code in a more   
user-friendly editor that lets you focus on learning to program, rather than   
learning to use an editor.

***PyCharm***

*PyCharm* is a popular IDE among Python programmers because it was built   
to work specifically with Python. The full version requires a paid subscrip-  
tion, but a free version called the PyCharm Community Edition is also   
available, and many developers find it useful.

If you try PyCharm, be aware that, by default, it sets up an isolated envi-

ronment for each of your projects. This is usually a good thing, but it can   
lead to unexpected behavior if you don't understand what it's doing for you.

***Jupyter Notebooks***

*Jupyter Notebook* is a different kind of tool than traditional text editors or   
IDEs, in that it's a web app primarily built of blocks; each block is either a   
code block or a text block. The text blocks are rendered in Markdown, so   
you can include simple formatting in your text blocks.

Jupyter Notebooks were developed to support the use of Python in

scientific applications, but they have since expanded to become useful in   
a wide variety of situations. Rather than just writing comments inside a *.py*   
file, you can write clear text with simple formatting, such as headers, bul-  
leted lists, and hyperlinks in between sections of code. Every code block can   
be run independently, allowing you to test small pieces of your program, or   
you can run all the code blocks at once. Each code block has its own output   
area, and you can toggle the output areas on or off as needed.

Jupyter Notebooks can be confusing at times because of the interactions

between different cells. If you define a function in one cell, that function is   
available to other cells as well. This is beneficial most of the time, but it can   
be confusing in longer notebooks and if you don't fully understand how the   
Notebook environment works.

If you're doing any scientific or data-focused work in Python, you'll

almost certainly see Jupyter Notebooks at some point.

**G E T T I N G H E L P**

Everyone gets stuck at some point when

they're learning to program. So, one of

the most important skills to learn as a pro-

grammer is how to get unstuck efficiently. This

appendix outlines several ways to help you get going   
again when programming gets confusing.

**First Steps**

When you're stuck, your first step should be to assess your situation. Before   
you ask for help from anyone else, answer the following three questions   
clearly:

â¢

What are you trying to do?

â¢

What have you tried so far?

â¢

What results have you been getting?  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress516.png)

**478**

Appendix C

Make your answers as specific as possible. For the first question, explicit

statements like "I'm trying to install the latest version of Python on my new   
Windows laptop" are detailed enough for others in the Python community   
to help you. Statements like "I'm trying to install Python" don't provide   
enough information for others to offer much help.

Your answer to the second question should provide enough detail so

you won't be advised to repeat what you've already tried: "I went t[o *https://
python.org/downloads* a](https://python.org/downloads)nd clicked the Download button for my system. Then   
I ran the installer" is more helpful than "I went to the Python website and   
downloaded something."

For the third question, it's helpful to know the exact error messages

you received, so you can use them to search online for a solution or provide   
them when asking for help.

Sometimes, just answering these three questions before you ask for help

from others allows you to see something you're missing, and helps get you   
unstuck without having to go any further. Programmers even have a name   
for this: *rubber duck debugging* . The idea is that if you clearly explain your   
situation to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object) and ask it a specific   
question, you'll often be able to answer your own question. Some program-  
ming teams even keep a real rubber duck around to encourage people to   
"talk to the duck."

***Try It Again***

Just going back to the start and trying again can be enough to solve many   
problems. Say you're trying to write a

for

loop based on an example in this

book. You might have only missed something simple, like a colon at the end   
of the

for

line. Going through the steps again might help you avoid repeat-

ing the same mistake.

***Take a Break***

If you've been working on the same problem for a while, taking a break is   
one of the best tactics you can try. When we work on the same task for long   
periods of time, our brains start to zero in on only one solution. We lose   
sight of the assumptions we've made, and taking a break helps us get a fresh   
perspective on the problem. It doesn't need to be a long break, just some-  
thing that gets you out of your current mindset. If you've been sitting for a   
long time, do something physical: take a short walk, go outside for a bit, or   
perhaps drink a glass of water or eat a light snack.

If you're getting frustrated, it might be worth putting your work away

for the day. A good night's sleep almost always makes a problem more   
approachable.

***Refer to This Book's Resources***

The online resources for this book, available at [*https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e* ,](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e)include a number of helpful sections about setting up your system and work-  
ing through each chapter. If you haven't done so already, take a look at these   
resources and see if there's anything that helps your situation.

**479**

**Searching Online**

Chances are good that someone else has had the same problem you're   
having and has written about it online. Good searching skills and specific   
inquiries will help you find existing resources to solve the issue you're fac-  
ing. For example, if you're struggling to install the latest version of Python   
on a new Windows system, searching for *install python windows* and limiting   
the results to resources from the last year might direct you to a clear answer.

Searching the exact error message can be extremely helpful too. For

example, say you get the following error when you try to run a Python pro-  
gram from a terminal on a new Windows system:

\>

**python hello_world.py**

Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft  
Store...

Searching for the full phrase, "Python was not found; run without argu-

ments to install from the Microsoft Store," will probably yield some good   
advice.

When you start searching for programming-related topics, a few sites

will appear repeatedly. I'll describe some of these sites briefly, so you'll   
know how helpful they're likely to be.

***Stack Overflow***

*Stack Overflow* [(*https://stackoverflow.com*) i](https://stackoverflow.com)s one of the most popular question-  
and-answer sites for programmers, and it will often appear in the first page   
of results on Python-related searches. Members post questions when they're   
stuck, and other members try to give helpful responses. Users can vote for   
the responses they find most helpful, so the best answers are usually the   
first ones you'll find.

Many basic Python questions have very clear answers on Stack Overflow,

because the community has refined them over time. Users are encouraged   
to post updates, too, so responses tend to stay relatively current. At the   
time of this writing, almost two million Python-related questions have been   
answered on Stack Overflow.

There's one expectation you should be aware of before posting on

Stack Overflow. Questions are meant to be the shortest example of the   
kind of issue you're facing. If you post 5--20 lines of code that generate the   
error you're facing, and if you address the questions mentioned in "[First
Steps" on page 477](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#515) earlier in this appendix, someone will probably help   
you. If you share a link to a project with multiple large files, people will be   
very unlikely to help. There's a great guide to writing up a good question   
at[*https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask*. T](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)he suggestions in this guide are   
applicable to getting help in any community of programmers.

***The Official Python Documentation***

The official Python documentatio[n (*https://docs.python.org*) i](https://docs.python.org)s a bit more   
hit-or-miss for beginners, because its purpose is more to document the  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress518.png)

**480**

Appendix C

language than to provide explanations. The examples in the official docu-  
mentation should work, but you might not understand everything shown.   
Still, it's a good resource to check when it comes up in your searches, and it   
will become more useful to you as you continue building your understand-  
ing of Python.

***Official Library Documentation***

If you're using a specific library, such as Pygame, Matplotlib, or Django,   
links to the official documentation for it will often appear in searches. For   
example, [*https://docs.djangoproject.com* i](https://docs.djangoproject.com)s very helpful when working with   
Django. If you're planning to work with any of these libraries, it's a good   
idea to become familiar with their official documentation.

***r/learnpython***

Reddit is made up of a number of subforums called *subreddits* . The *r/learnpython*   
subreddit[(*https://reddit.com/r/learnpython*](https://reddit.com/r/learnpython)) is very active and supportive. You   
can read others' questions and post your own as well. You will often get mul-  
tiple perspectives about the questions you raise, which can be really helpful   
in gaining a deeper understanding of the topic you're working on.

***Blog Posts***

Many programmers maintain blogs and share posts about the parts of the   
language they're working with. You should look for a date on the blog posts   
you find, to see how applicable the information is likely to be for the version   
of Python you're using.

**Discord**

*Discord* is an online chat environment with a Python community where you   
can ask for help and follow Python-related discussions.

To check it out, head to [*https://pythondiscord.com*](https://pythondiscord.com) and click the **Discord**

link at the upper right. If you already have a Discord account, you can log in   
with your existing account. If you don't have an account, enter a username   
and follow the prompts to complete your Discord registration.

If this is your first time visiting the Python Discord, you'll need to accept

the rules for the community before participating fully. Once you've done   
that, you can join any of the channels that interest you. If you're looking for   
help, be sure to post in one of the Python Help channels.

**Slack**

*Slack* is another online chat environment. It is often used for internal com-  
pany communications, but there are also many public groups you can join.   
If you want to check out Python Slack groups, start with [*https://pyslackers.com* .](https://pyslackers.com)Click the **Slack** link at the top of the page, then enter your email address to   
get an invitation.

Once you're in the Python Developers workspace, you'll see a list of

channels. Click **Channels** and then choose the topics that interest you. You

Version control software allows you to take

snapshots of a project whenever it's in a

working state. When you make changes to a

project---for example, when you implement a

new feature---you can go back to a previous working   
state if the project's current state isn't functioning well.

Using version control software gives you the freedom to work on improve-

ments and make mistakes without worrying about ruining your project. This   
is especially critical in large projects, but can also be helpful in smaller proj-  
ects, even when you're working on programs contained in a single file.

In this appendix, you'll learn to install Git and use it for version control in

the programs you're working on now. *Git* is the most popular version control   
software in use today. Many of its advanced tools help teams collaborate on   
large projects, but its most basic features also work well for solo developers.   
Git implements version control by tracking the changes made to every file in a   
project; if you make a mistake, you can just return to a previously saved state.

Appendix D

**Installing Git**

Git runs on all operating systems, but there are different approaches to   
installing it on each system. The following sections provide specific instruc-  
tions for each operating system.

Git is included on some systems by default, and is often bundled with

other packages that you might have already installed. Before trying to install   
Git, see if it's already on your system. Open a new terminal window and issue   
the command

**git --version**

. If you see output listing a specific version num-

ber, Git is installed on your system. If you see a message prompting you to   
install or update Git, follow the onscreen instructions.

If you don't see any onscreen instructions and you're using Windows or

macOS, you can download an installer from [*https://git-scm.com*. I](https://git-scm.com)f you're a   
Linux user with an apt-compatible system, you can install Git with the com-  
mand

**sudo apt install git**

.

***Configuring Git***

Git keeps track of who makes changes to a project, even when only one per-  
son is working on the project. To do this, Git needs to know your username   
and email. You must provide a username, but you can make up a fake email   
address:

$

**git config --global user.name "**

***username***

**"**

$

**git config --global user.email "**

***username@example.com***

**"**

If you forget this step, Git will prompt you for this information when

you make your first commit.

It's also best to set the default name for the main branch in each proj-

ect. A good name for this branch is

main

:

$

**git config --global init.defaultBranch main**

This configuration means that each new project you use Git to manage

will start out with a single branch of commits called *main*.

**Making a Project**

Let's make a project to work with. Create a folder somewhere on your sys-  
tem called *git_practice*. Inside the folder, make a simple Python program:

*hello_git.py*

print("Hello Git world!")

We'll use this program to explore Git's basic functionality.

**Ignoring Files**

Files with the extension *.pyc* are automatically generated from *.py* files, so we   
don't need Git to keep track of them. These files are stored in a directory  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress523.png)

Using Git for Version Control

**485**

called *__pycache__* . To tell Git to ignore this directory, make a special   
file called *.gitignore* ---with a dot at the beginning of the filename and no file   
extension---and add the following line to it:

*.gitignore*

__pycache__/

This file tells Git to ignore any file in the *__pycache__* directory. Using a

*.gitignore* file will keep your project clutter-free and easier to work with.

You might need to modify your file browser's settings so hidden files

(files whose names begin with a dot) will be shown. In Windows Explorer,   
check the box in the View menu labeled **Hidden Items**. On macOS, press

â

-SHIFT-. (dot). On Linux, look for a setting labeled Show Hidden Files.

**NOTE**

*If you're on macOS, add one more line to* .gitignore*. Add the name*

*.DS_Store*

*; these*

*are hidden files that contain information about each directory on macOS, and they
will clutter up your project if you don't add them to* .gitignore*.*

**Initializing a Repository**

Now that you have a directory containing a Python file and a *.gitignore* file,   
you can initialize a Git repository. Open a terminal, navigate to the *git_practice*   
folder, and run the following command:

git_practice$

**git init**

Initialized empty Git repository in git_practice/.git/  
git_practice$

The output shows that Git has initialized an empty repository in

*git_practice* . A *repository* is the set of files in a program that Git is actively   
tracking. All the files Git uses to manage the repository are located in the   
hidden directory *.git* , which you won't need to work with at all. Just don't   
delete that directory, or you'll lose your project's history.

**Checking the Status**

Before doing anything else, let's look at the project's status:

git_practice$

**git status**

1

On branch main

No commits yet

2

Untracked files:

(use "git add \<file\>..." to include in what will be committed)  
.gitignore  
hello_git.py

3

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

git_practice$  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress524.png)

**486**

Appendix D

In Git, a *branch* is a version of the project you're working on; here you

can see that we're on a branch named

main

1

. Each time you check your

project's status, it should show that you're on the branch

main

. You then see

that we're about to make the initial commit. A *commit* is a snapshot of the   
project at a particular point in time.

Git informs us that untracked files are in the project

2

, because we

haven't told it which files to track yet. Then we're told that there's nothing   
added to the current commit, but untracked files are present that we might   
want to add to the repository

3

.

**Adding Files to the Repository**

Let's add the two files to the repository and check the status again:

1

git_practice$

**git add .**

2

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
No commits yet

Changes to be committed:  
(use "git rm --cached \<file\>..." to unstage)

3

new file: .gitignore

new file: hello_git.py

git_practice$

The command

git add .

adds to the repository all files within a project

that aren't already being tracked

1

, as long as they're not listed in *.gitignore*.

It doesn't commit the files; it just tells Git to start paying attention to them.   
When we check the status of the project now, we can see that Git recognizes   
some changes that need to be committed

2

. The label *new file* means these

files were newly added to the repository

3

.

**Making a Commit**

Let's make the first commit:

1

git_practice$

**git commit -m "Started project."**

2

\[main (root-commit) cea13dd\] Started project.

3

2 files changed, 5 insertions(+)

create mode 100644 .gitignore  
create mode 100644 hello_git.py

4

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working tree clean  
git_practice$

We issue the command

git commit -m "

*message*

"

1

to make a snapshot of

the project. The

-m

flag tells Git to record the message that follows (

Started  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress525.png)

Using Git for Version Control

**487**

project.

) in the project's log. The output shows that we're on the

main

branch

2

and that two files have changed

3

.

When we check the status now, we can see that we're on the

main

branch,

and we have a clean working tree

4

. This is the message you should see

each time you commit a working state of your project. If you get a different   
message, read it carefully; it's likely you forgot to add a file before making a   
commit.

**Checking the Log**

Git keeps a log of all commits made to the project. Let's check the log:

git_practice$

**git log**

commit cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 (HEAD -\> main)  
Author: eric \<eric@example.com\>  
Date: Mon Jun 6 19:37:26 2022 -0800

Started project.  
git_practice$

Each time you make a commit, Git generates a unique, 40-character

reference ID. It records who made the commit, when it was made, and the   
message recorded. You won't always need all of this information, so Git pro-  
vides an option to print a simpler version of the log entries:

git_practice$

**git log --pretty=oneline**

cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 (HEAD -\> main) Started project.  
git_practice$

The

--pretty=oneline

flag provides the two most important pieces of

information: the reference ID of the commit and the message recorded for   
the commit.

**The Second Commit**

To see the real power of version control, we need to make a change to the proj-  
ect and commit that change. Here we'll just add another line to *hello_git.py*:

*hello_git.py*

print("Hello Git world!")

print("Hello everyone.")

When we check the status of the project, we'll see that Git has noticed

the file that changed:

git_practice$

**git status**

1

On branch main

Changes not staged for commit:  
(use "git add \<file\>..." to update what will be committed)  
(use "git restore \<file\>..." to discard changes in working directory)  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress526.png)

**488**

Appendix D

2

modified: hello_git.py

3

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

git_practice$

We see the branch we're working on

1

, the name of the file that was

modified

2

, and that no changes have been committed

3

. Let's commit

the change and check the status again:

1

git_practice$

**git commit -am "Extended greeting."**

\[main 945fa13\] Extended greeting.  
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

2

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working tree clean

3

git_practice$

**git log --pretty=oneline**

945fa13af128a266d0114eebb7a3276f7d58ecd2 (HEAD -\> main) Extended greeting.  
cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 Started project.  
git_practice$

We make a new commit, passing the

-am

flags when we use the command

git commit

1

. The

-a

flag tells Git to add all modified files in the repository

to the current commit. (If you create any new files between commits, reissue   
the

git add .

command to include the new files in the repository.) The

-m

flag

tells Git to record a message in the log for this commit.

When we check the project's status, we see that we once again have a

clean working tree

2

. Finally, we see the two commits in the log

3

.

**Abandoning Changes**

Now let's look at how to abandon a change and go back to the previous   
working state. First, add a new line to *hello_git.py*:

*hello_git.py*

print("Hello Git world!")  
print("Hello everyone.")

print("Oh no, I broke the project!")

Save and run this file.  
We check the status and see that Git notices this change:

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
Changes not staged for commit:  
(use "git add \<file\>..." to update what will be committed)  
(use "git restore \<file\>..." to discard changes in working directory)

1

modified: hello_git.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")  
git_practice$  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress527.png)

Using Git for Version Control

**489**

Git sees that we modified *hello_git.py*

1

, and we can commit the change

if we want to. But this time, instead of committing the change, we'll go back   
to the last commit when we knew our project was working. We won't do any-  
thing to *hello_git.py* : we won't delete the line or use the Undo feature in the   
text editor. Instead, enter the following commands in your terminal session:

git_practice$

**git restore .**

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working tree clean  
git_practice$

The command

git restore

*filename*

allows you to abandon all changes

since the last commit in a specific file. The command

git restore .

aban-

dons all changes made in all files since the last commit; this action restores   
the project to the last committed state.

When you return to your text editor, you'll see that *hello_git.py* has

changed back to this:

print("Hello Git world!")  
print("Hello everyone.")

Although going back to a previous state might seem trivial in this simple

project, if we were working on a large project with dozens of modified files,   
all the files that had changed since the last commit would be restored. This   
feature is incredibly useful: you can make as many changes as you want   
when implementing a new feature, and if they don't work, you can discard   
them without affecting the project. You don't have to remember those   
changes and manually undo them. Git does all of that for you.

**N O T E**

*You might have to refresh the file in your editor to see the restored version.*

**Checking Out Previous Commits**

You can revisit any commit in your log, using the

checkout

command, by

using the first six characters of a reference ID. After checking out and   
reviewing an earlier commit, you can return to the latest commit or aban-  
don your recent work and pick up development from the earlier commit:

git_practice$

**git log --pretty=oneline**

945fa13af128a266d0114eebb7a3276f7d58ecd2 (HEAD -\> main) Extended greeting.  
cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 Started project.  
git_practice$

**git checkout cea13d**

Note: switching to 'cea13d'.

1

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental

changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this  
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress528.png)

**490**

Appendix D

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may  
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

git switch -c \<new-branch-name\>

2

Or undo this operation with:

git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at cea13d Started project.  
git_practice$

When you check out a previous commit, you leave the main branch and

enter what Git refers to as a *detached HEAD* state

1

. *HEAD* is the current

committed state of the project; you're *detached* because you've left a named   
branch (

main

, in this case).

To get back to the

main

branch, you follow the suggestion

2

to undo the

previous operation:

git_practice$

**git switch -**

Previous HEAD position was cea13d Started project.  
Switched to branch 'main'  
git_practice$

This command brings you back to the

main

branch. Unless you want

to work with some more advanced features of Git, it's best not to make   
any changes to your project when you've checked out a previous commit.   
However, if you're the only one working on a project and you want to dis-  
card all of the more recent commits and go back to a previous state, you   
can reset the project to a previous commit. Working from the

main

branch,

enter the following:

1

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working directory clean

2

git_practice$

**git log --pretty=oneline**

945fa13af128a266d0114eebb7a3276f7d58ecd2 (HEAD -\> main) Extended greeting.  
cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 Started project.

3

git_practice$

**git reset --hard cea13d**

HEAD is now at cea13dd Started project.

4

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working directory clean

5

git_practice$

**git log --pretty=oneline**

cea13ddc51b885d05a410201a54faf20e0d2e246 (HEAD -\> main) Started project.  
git_practice$

We first check the status to make sure we're on the

main

branch

1

.

When we look at the log, we see both commits

2

. We then issue the

git

reset --hard

command with the first six characters of the reference ID of  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress529.png)

Using Git for Version Control

**491**

the commit we want to go back to permanently

3

. We check the status

again and see we're on the

main

branch with nothing to commit

4

. When

we look at the log again, we see that we're at the commit we wanted to start   
over from

5

.

**Deleting the Repository**

Sometimes you'll mess up your repository's history and won't know how to   
recover it. If this happens, first consider asking for help using the approaches   
discussed i[n Appendix C. I](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#515)f you can't fix it and you're working on a solo proj-  
ect, you can continue working with the files but get rid of the project's history   
by deleting the *.git* directory. This won't affect the current state of any of the   
files, but it will delete all commits, so you won't be able to check out any other   
states of the project.

To do this, either open a file browser and delete the *.git* repository or

delete it from the command line. Afterward, you'll need to start over with a   
fresh repository to start tracking your changes again. Here's what this entire   
process looks like in a terminal session:

1

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working directory clean

2

git_practice$

**rm -rf .git/**

3

git_practice$

**git status**

fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

4

git_practice$

**git init**

Initialized empty Git repository in git_practice/.git/

5

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
No commits yet

Untracked files:  
(use "git add \<file\>..." to include in what will be committed)  
.gitignore  
hello_git.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

6

git_practice$

**git add .**

git_practice$

**git commit -m "Starting over."**

\[main (root-commit) 14ed9db\] Starting over.  
2 files changed, 5 insertions(+)  
create mode 100644 .gitignore  
create mode 100644 hello_git.py

7

git_practice$

**git status**

On branch main  
nothing to commit, working tree clean  
git_practice$

We first check the status and see that we have a clean working direc-

tory

1

. Then we use the command

rm -rf .git/

to delete the *.git* directory

(

del .git

on Windows)

2

. When we check the status after deleting the *.git*

**492**

Appendix D

folder, we're told that this is not a Git repository

3

. All the information Git

uses to track a repository is stored in the *.git* folder, so removing it deletes   
the entire repository.

We're then free to use

git init

to start a fresh repository

4

. Checking

the status shows that we're back at the initial stage, awaiting the first com-  
mit

5

. We add the files and make the first commit

6

. Checking the status

now shows us that we're on the new

main

branch with nothing to commit

7

.

Using version control takes a bit of practice, but once you start using it,

you'll never want to work without it again.

Deploying an app is tremendously satisfy-

ing when it works, especially if you've never

done it before. However, there are many

obstacles that can arise in the deployment pro-

cess, and unfortunately, some of these issues can be   
difficult to identify and address. This appendix will   
help you understand modern approaches to deploy-  
ment and give you specific ways to troubleshoot the   
deployment process when things aren't working.

If the additional information in this appendix isn't enough to help you

get through the deployment process successfully, see the online resources at   
[*https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e*; t](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e)he updates there will almost certainly help   
you carry out a successful deployment.

**494**

Appendix E

**Understanding Deployments**

When you're trying to troubleshoot a particular deployment attempt, it's   
helpful to have a clear understanding of how a typical deployment works.   
*Deployment* refers to the process of taking a project that works on your local   
system, and copying that project to a remote server in a way that allows it   
to respond to requests from any user on the internet. The remote environ-  
ment differs from a typical local system in a number of important ways: it's   
probably not the same operating system (OS) as the one you're using, and   
it's most likely one of many virtual servers on a single physical server.

When you deploy a project, or *push* it to the remote server, the following

steps need to be taken:

â¢

Create a virtual server on a physical machine at a datacenter.

â¢

Establish a connection between the local system and the remote server.

â¢

Copy the project's code to the remote server.

â¢

Identify all of the project's dependencies and install them on the   
remote server.

â¢

Set up a database and run any existing migrations.

â¢

Copy static files (CSS, JavaScript files, and media files) to a place where   
they can be served efficiently.

â¢

Start a server to handle incoming requests.

â¢

Start routing incoming requests to the project, once it's ready to handle   
requests.

When you consider all that goes into a deployment, it's no wonder

deployments often fail. Fortunately, once you gain an understanding of   
what should be happening, you'll stand a better chance of identifying what   
went wrong. If you can identify what went wrong, you might be able to iden-  
tify a fix that will make the next deployment attempt successful.

You can develop locally on one kind of OS and push to a server running

a different OS. It's important to know what kind of system you're pushing to,   
because that can inform some of your troubleshooting work. At the time of   
this writing, a basic remote server on Platform.sh runs Debian Linux; most   
remote servers are Linux-based systems.

**Basic Troubleshooting**

Some troubleshooting steps are specific to each OS, but we'll get to that in   
a moment. First, let's consider the steps everyone should try when trouble-  
shooting a deployment.

Your best resource is the output generated during the attempted

push. This output can look intimidating; if you're new to deploying apps,   
it can look highly technical, and there's usually a lot of it. The good news   
is you don't need to understand everything in the output. You should have   
two goals when skimming log output: identify any deployment steps that   
worked, and identify any steps that didn't. If you can do this, you might be  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress533.png)

Troubleshooting Deployments

**495**

able to figure out what to change in your project, or in your deployment   
process, to make your next push successful.

***Follow Onscreen Suggestions***

Sometimes, the platform you're pushing to will generate a message that has   
a clear suggestion for how to address the issue. For example, here's the mes-  
sage you'll see if you create a Platform.sh project before initializing a Git   
repository, and then try to push the project:

$

**platform push**

1

Enter a number to choose a project:

\[0\] ll_project (votohz445ljyg)  
\>

**0**

2

\[RootNotFoundException\]

Project root not found. This can only be run from inside a project  
directory.

3

To set the project for this Git repository, run:

platform project:set-remote \[id\]

We're trying to push a project, but the local project hasn't been associ-

ated with a remote project yet. So, the Platform.sh CLI asks which remote   
project we want to push to

1

. We enter

**0**

, to select the only project listed.

But next, we see a

RootNotFoundException

2

. This happens because Platform.sh

looks for a *.git* directory when it inspects the local project, to figure out   
how to connect the local project with the remote project. In this case, since   
there was no *.git* directory when the remote project was created, that con-  
nection was never established. The CLI suggests a fix

3

; it's telling us that

we can specify the remote project that should be associated with this local   
project, using the

project:set-remote

command.

Let's try this suggestion:

$

**platform project:set-remote votohz445ljyg**

Setting the remote project for this repository to: ll_project (votohz445ljyg)

The remote project for this repository is  
now set to: ll_project (votohz445ljyg)

In the previous output, the CLI showed the ID of this remote project,

votohz4451jyg

. So we run the command that's suggested, using this ID, and

the CLI is able to make the connection between the local project and the   
remote project.

Now let's try to push the project again:

$

**platform push**

Are you sure you want to push to the main (production) branch? \[Y/n\]

**y**

Pushing HEAD to the existing environment main

*--snip--*

This was a successful push; following the onscreen suggestion worked.

Appendix E

You should be careful about running commands that you don't fully

understand. However, if you have good reason to believe that a command   
can do little harm, and if you trust the source of the recommendation, it   
might be reasonable to try the suggestions offered by the tools you're using.

**N O T E**

*Keep in mind there are individuals who will tell you to run commands that will wipe*

*your system or expose your system to remote exploitation. Following the suggestions of
a tool provided by a company or organization you trust is different from following the
suggestions of random people online. Anytime you're dealing with remote connections,
proceed with an abundance of caution.*

***Read the Log Output***

As mentioned earlier, the log output that you see when you run a command   
like

platform push

can be both informative and intimidating. Read through

the following snippet of log output, taken from a different attempt at using

platform push

, and see if you can spot the issue:

*--snip--*

W: ERROR: No matching distribution found for gunicorrn

Executing pre-flight checks...

*--snip--*

When a deployment attempt fails, a good strategy is to look through

the log output and see if you can spot anything that looks like warnings or   
errors. Warnings are fairly common; they're often messages about upcom-  
ing changes in a project's dependencies, to help developers address issues   
before they cause actual failures.

A successful push may have warnings, but it shouldn't have any errors.

In this case, Platform.sh couldn't find a way to install the requirement

gunicorrn

. This is a typo in the *requirements_remote.txt* file, which was sup-

posed to include

gunicorn

(with one *r*). It's not always easy to spot the root

issue in log output, especially when the problem causes a bunch of cascad-  
ing errors and warnings. Just like when reading a traceback on your local   
system, it's a good idea to look closely at the first few errors that are listed,   
and also the last few errors. Most of the errors in between tend to be inter-  
nal packages complaining that something went wrong, and passing mes-  
sages about the error to other internal packages. The actual error we can   
fix is usually one of the first or last errors listed.

Troubleshooting Deployments

**497**

Sometimes, you'll be able to spot the error, and other times, you'll have

no idea what the output means. It's certainly worth a try, and using log out-  
put to successfully diagnose an error is a tremendously satisfying feeling. As   
you spend more time looking through log output, you'll get better at identi-  
fying the information that's most meaningful to you.

**OS-Specific Troubleshooting**

You can develop on any operating system you like and push to any host   
you like. The tools for pushing projects have developed enough that they'll   
modify your project as needed to run correctly on the remote system.   
However, there are some OS-specific issues that can arise.

In the Platform.sh deployment process, one of the most likely sources

of difficulties is installing the CLI. Here's the command to do so:

$

**curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer \| php**

The command starts with

curl

, a tool that lets you request remote

resources, accessed through a URL, within a terminal. Here, it's being used   
to download the CLI installer from a Platform.sh server. The

-fsS

section of

the command is a set of flags that modify how curl runs. The

f

flag tells curl

to suppress most error messages, so the CLI installer can handle them instead   
of reporting them all to you. The

s

flag tells curl to run silently; it lets the CLI

installer decide what information to show in the terminal. The

S

flag tells curl

to show an error message if the overall command fails. The

\| php

at the end

of the command tells your system to run the downloaded installer file using a   
PHP interpreter, because the Platform.sh CLI is written in PHP.

This means your system needs curl and PHP in order to install the

Platform.sh CLI. To use the CLI, you'll also need Git, and a terminal that   
can run Bash commands. *Bash* is a language that's available in most server   
environments. Most modern systems have plenty of room for multiple tools   
like this to be installed.

The following sections will help you address these requirements for

your OS. If you don't already have Git installed, see the instructions for   
installing Git on [page 484 in](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#522)[Appendix D](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#521) and then go to the section here   
that's applicable to your OS.

**N O T E**

*An excellent tool for understanding terminal commands like the one shown here is*

<https://explainshell.com>*. Enter the command you're trying to understand, and
the site will show you the documentation for all the parts of your command. Try it

***Deploying from Windows***

Windows has seen a resurgence in popularity with programmers in recent   
years. Windows has integrated many different elements of other operating   
systems, providing users with a number of options for how to do local devel-  
opment work and interact with remote systems.  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress536.png)

**498**

Appendix E

One of the most significant difficulties in deploying from Windows is

that the core Windows operating system is not the same as what a Linux-  
based remote server uses. A base Windows system has a different set of tools   
and languages than a base Linux system, so to carry out deployment work   
from Windows, you'll need to choose how to integrate Linux-based tool sets   
into your local environment.

**Windows Subsystem for Linux**

One popular approach is to use *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (*WSL* ), an envi-  
ronment that allows Linux to run directly on Windows. If you have WSL   
set up, using the Platform.sh CLI on Windows becomes as easy as using it   
on Linux. The CLI won't know it's running on Windows; it will just see the   
Linux environment you're using it in.

Setting up WSL is a two-step process: you first install WSL, and then

choose a Linux distribution to install into the WSL environment. Setting up   
a WSL environment is more than can be described here; if you're interested   
in this approach and don't already have it set up, see the documentation at   
[*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). Once you have WSL set up,   
you can follow the instructions in the Linux section of this appendix to con-  
tinue your deployment work.

**Git Bash**

Another approach to building a local environment that you can deploy   
from uses *Git Bash* , a terminal environment that's compatible with Bash   
but runs on Windows. Git Bash is installed along with Git when you use   
the installer fro[m *https://git-scm.com*. T](https://git-scm.com)his approach can work, but it isn't as   
streamlined as WSL. In this approach, you'll have to use a Windows termi-  
nal for some steps and a Git Bash terminal for others.

First you'll need to install PHP. You can do this with *XAMPP*, a package

that bundles PHP with a few other developer-focused tools. Go to [*https://
apachefriends.org*](https://apachefriends.org) and click the button to download XAMPP for Windows.   
Open the installer and run it; if you see a warning about User Account   
Control (UAC) restrictions, click **OK**. Accept all of the installer's defaults.

When the installer finishes running, you'll need to add PHP to your

system's path; this will tell Windows where to look when you want to run   
PHP. In the Start menu, enter

**path**

and click **Edit the System Environment**

**Variables** ; click the button labeled **Environment Variables** . You should see   
the variable

Path

highlighted; click **Edit** under this pane. Click **New** to add

a new path to the current list of paths. Assuming you kept the default set-  
tings when running the XAMPP installer, add

**C:\\xampp\\php**

in the box that

appears, then click **OK** . When you're finished, close all of the system dia-  
logs that are still open.

With these requirements taken care of, you can install the Platform.sh

CLI. You'll need to use a Windows terminal with administrator privileges;   
enter

**command**

into the Start menu, and under the Command Prompt app,  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress537.png)

Troubleshooting Deployments

**499**

click **Run as administrator** . In the terminal that appears, enter the follow-  
ing command:

\>

**curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer \| php**

This will install the Platform.sh CLI, as described earlier.  
Finally, you'll work in Git Bash. To open a Git Bash terminal, go to the

Start menu and search for

**git bash**

. Click the **Git Bash app** that appears;

you should see a terminal window open. You can use traditional Linux-  
based commands like

ls

in this terminal, as well as Windows-based com-

mands like

dir

. To make sure the installation was successful, issue the

**platform list**

command. You should see a list of all the commands in the

Platform.sh CLI. From this point forward, carry out all of your deployment   
work using the Platform.sh CLI inside a Git Bash terminal window.

***Deploying from macOS***

The macOS operating system is not based on Linux, but they were both   
developed on similar principles. What this means, practically, is that a lot of   
the commands and workflows that you use on macOS will work in a remote   
server environment as well. You might need to install some developer-focused   
resources in order to have all of these tools available in your local macOS   
environment. If you get a prompt to install the *command line developer tools* at   
any point in your work, click **Install** to approve the installation.

The most likely difficulty when installing the Platform.sh CLI is mak-

ing sure PHP is installed. If you see a message that the

php

command is not

found, you'll need to install PHP. One of the easiest ways to install PHP is   
by using the *Homebrew* package manager, which facilitates the installation   
of a wide variety of packages that programmers depend on. If you don't   
already have Homebrew installed, visi[t *https://brew.sh*](https://brew.sh) and follow the instruc-  
tions to install it.

Once Homebrew is installed, use the following command to install PHP:

$

**brew install php**

This will take a while to run, but once it has completed, you should be

able to successfully install the Platform.sh CLI.

***Deploying from Linux***

Because most server environments are Linux-based, you should have very   
little difficulty installing and using the Platform.sh CLI. If you try to install   
the CLI on a system with a fresh installation of Ubuntu, it will tell you   
exactly which packages you need:

$

**curl -fsS https://platform.sh/cli/installer \| php**

Command 'curl' not found, but can be installed with:  
sudo apt install curl  
Command 'php' not found, but can be installed with:  
sudo apt install php-cli  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress538.png)

**500**

Appendix E

The actual output will have more information about a few other pack-

ages that would work, plus some version information. The following com-  
mand will install curl and PHP:

$

**sudo apt install curl php-cli**

After running this command, the Platform.sh CLI installation com-

mand should run successfully. Since your local environment is quite similar   
to most Linux-based hosting environments, much of what you learn about   
working in your terminal will carry over to working in a remote environ-  
ment as well.

**Other Deployment Approaches**

If Platform.sh doesn't work for you, or if you want to try a different approach,   
there are many hosting platforms to choose from. Some work similarly to the   
process described i[n Chapter 20, a](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress.html#471)nd some have a much different approach   
to carrying out the steps described at the beginning of this appendix:

â¢

Platform.sh allows you to use a browser to carry out the steps we used   
the CLI for. If you like browser-based interfaces better than terminal-  
based workflows, you may prefer this approach.

â¢

There are a number of other hosting providers that offer both CLI- and   
browser-based approaches. Some of these providers offer terminals   
within their browser, so you don't have to install anything on your   
system.

â¢

Some providers allow you to push your project to a remote code hosting   
site like GitHub, and then connect your GitHub repository to the host-  
ing site. The host then pulls your code from GitHub, instead of requir-  
ing you to push your code from your local system directly to the host.   
Platform.sh supports this kind of workflow as well.

â¢

Some providers offer an array of services that you select from, in   
order to put together an infrastructure that works for your project.   
This typically requires you to have a deeper understanding of the   
deployment process, and what a remote server needs in order to   
serve a project. These hosts include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and   
Microsoft's Azure platform. It can be much harder to track your costs   
in these kinds of platforms, because each service can accrue charges   
independently.

â¢

Many people host their projects on a virtual private server (VPS). In this   
approach, you rent a virtual server that acts just like a remote computer,   
log in to the server, install the software needed to run your project, copy   
your code over, set the right connections, and allow your server to start   
accepting requests.

New hosting platforms and approaches appear on a regular basis; find

one that looks appealing to you, and invest the time to learn that provider's   
deployment process. Maintain your project long enough so that you get to  
![background image](python-crash-course-3nbsped-1718502702-9781718502703_compress539.png)

Troubleshooting Deployments

**501**

know what works well with your provider's approach and what doesn't. No   
hosting platform is going to be perfect; you'll need to make an ongoing   
judgement call about whether the provider you're currently using is good   
enough for your use case.

I'll offer one last word of caution about choosing a deployment plat-

form and an overall approach to deployment. Some people will enthusiasti-  
cally steer you toward overly complex deployment approaches and services   
that are meant to make your project highly reliable and capable of serving   
millions of users simultaneously. Many programmers spend lots of time,   
money, and energy building out a complex deployment strategy, only to   
find that hardly anyone is using their project. Most Django projects can be   
set up on a small hosting plan and tuned to serve thousands of requests per   
minute. If your project is getting anything less than this level of traffic, take   
the time to configure your deployment to work well on a minimal platform   
before investing in infrastructure that's meant for some of the largest sites   
in the world.

Deployment is incredibly challenging at times, but just as satisfying

when your live project works well. Enjoy the challenge, and ask for help   
when you need it.
